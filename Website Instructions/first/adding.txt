How To Edit the CLS Website with Dreamweaver

*Adding the Site to Dreamweaver*
Note: If it isn't already there in the "Files" pane (check the pulldown
menu and look for CLS), you must add the site to dreamweaver. All of 
the necessary files to edit the website are on the server. 

1) Open up dreamweaver and go to "Site" --> "New Site"

2) Under Local Info
"Site name" can be anything you want, its just he name Dreamweaver
referes to it as.

"Local Root Folder" is where you want to store the site on your
computer. It's probably best to put it in your Documents folder.

You can leave the default images folder blank, I don't think it
matters. I've also been leaving links relative to document. 

"HTTP Address" is http://lsrg.psu.edu"

3) Under Remote Info
Access: FTP

FTP Host: splogin.cac.psu.edu

Host Directory: /.../dce.psu.edu/fs/services/www/dept/lsrg/

Login and Password: your psu id and pass (contact IST to get access to modify the site)

Make sure to check "Use Secure FTP"

Everything else should be fine as is.

4) On the files pane, click "get files" and the site should be
downloaded to your computer.
