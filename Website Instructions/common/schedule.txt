Updating The Schedule

On our website there are two schedules. One is a mini-schedule that is
displayed on every page. The other is more elaborate and gets its on
webpage. 

When adding, removing, or changing an event, always update both
schedules. 

I usually just copy and paste or change a prior event to make a new
event. Some example formats are listed below.

**Editing Mini-Schedule
Open up the file schedule.ssi under the includes folder. This page should be completely blank
except for upcoming events.

The format I like to follow for events is:
*Each event gets its own paragraph tag. Try to keep things short by
abbreviating. Also  try to keep the event to 2 lines. After each line
add a line break "<br>".

Example:
<p>Mon., Apr 24<br>
   ERP Equipment Set-up</p><br>

**Editing Full Schedule
Again each event gets its own paragraph tag. This tag should use the
id "hang_indent". Lines should end in a break.

Example
<p class="hang_indent"><strong>Ann Bradlow Talk</strong> - <em>Friday, April 11th, 10am - 453 Moore</em><br />
    <em>Put the title of the talk here</em><br /><br />
        Put some info about the talk here: Speech communication involves a chain of events that... blah
	blah blah</em></p>
