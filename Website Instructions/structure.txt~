|    This contains all the images used on the site except for images
|    of people, which are located under the people folder.
|
|---/includes
|    This folder is where I put server-side includes. If you aren't
|    sure what they are, that's OK. What you do need to be concearned
|    with is that the code for the menu bar and mini-schedule are in
|    here.

|    This is the location of some old cls web pages that
|    haven't been migrated yet, just in case.

|    affiliates, students, etc. They are all catagorized in seperate
|    folders.

|	      CVs.

|
|---/styles
|    Contains all my CSS styles used by the website.
|    
|---/Templates
     Contains dreamweaver templates. These won't have to be modified
     often. I would make sure to backup the entire site before
     modifying these. Early on I messed up some pages I had already
     made and fixing them was not fun.
