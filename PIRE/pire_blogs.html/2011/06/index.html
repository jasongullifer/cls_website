        <div class="asset-body">
            Along with many other Penn Staters, I attended the 8th International Symposium on Bilingualism on 15-18 June in Oslo, Norway. Generally speaking, it was quite a transition leaving Beijing and waking up in Oslo. I'll leave the cities' and cultures' respective differences for another discussion, but what I found curiously difficult was making the transition from being in a foreign country where English proficiency is relatively low to one where English proficiency is widespread and very high. It seems that not being able to read the signs at the store is a pretty strong cue to inhibiting (socially and/or linguistically) my English production, as I did very little communicating with the Norwegians my first few days and ended up shopping at the Chinese grocery store where I was more comfortable struggling with Chinese than trying to convince myself it was OK to speak English with Norwegians. Fortunately (as I elaborate below), it proved to be a temporary condition...<br />

            <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal">While thinking about what to
write about as my final blog post, I decided that a reflection on my time here
would be the most appropriate. First, let me say that this experience was
definitely worth it. I think that I was able to learn so much not only about
linguistics but also just about life in general. I was able to meet new and
interesting people and truly experience something new and outside of my comfort
zone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal">When I started out in Granada I
was not really sure what to think. I initially questioned whether or not
studying abroad would be as great as everyone has always made it out to be.
Quickly I realized that it is in fact exactly that- one of the best experiences
of my life. I also was not entirely sure what to think about working in a new
lab with new people. How would I be received? Would I just be viewed as the
major inconvenience in their lives? However, after going to the university that
first day, I saw that that was the exact opposite of what was happening.
Everyone at the University of Granada made me feel way more than welcome. Not
once did I feel as though I was thought of as the American that was in the way
or super inconvenient (even at the times when it was probably well-deserved;
there were many weeks in which Lauren and I took a lot of space for a long time
in order to run participants). I am so grateful for how accommodating everyone
was and honestly the overall air of cordialness that I experienced when I
arrived. It really made the transition to working here a lot easier.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal">I think most importantly, though,
was that I learned a lot more about my individual project and the general
process of running participants. I had no idea what to expect when setting out
to recruit participants. Would we be able to get any to come in? Would they
have trouble with the experiment itself? Would I be able to adequately and
correctly explain everything in Spanish? I was very pleased when we were able
to get the amount of participants that we did. On one day in particular (it was
a Friday too) we had four people show up on their own accord, bringing our
total for that day alone to nine! And really, most of the other days that ran
participants, we had a pretty good amount. However, there were those days when
we had a lot of no-shows (mainly when it rained), but I feel as though all of
the other days really made up for it. And most of all, we made our end goal of
56 participants plus an additional four, bringing our total to 60. I am so glad
that I was able to work with Lauren on this part because we definitely managed
to create a pretty smooth system when running participants. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal">In the end, I am honestly really
sad to be leaving Granada in less than a week. I have a hard time remembering
where all that time went. It feels like I just arrived and already, I am
heading back to the States. For any current PIRE students still at their host
sites, I hope that the rest of your time is as great as mine has been. And for
any future PIRE-Granada students, I am sure that you will have an amazing time
here. It is one of the best places that I have been to and I am truly grateful
for this amazing opportunity.</p>

            PIRE has opened up many opportunities for us. Some were expected, but there has been so much more that I didn't see coming. While the PIRE partnerships are important for bridging gaps between universities around the world, it is just as important to bring together different people and disciplines. It creates a well-rounded scholar and a multicultural individual. With this experience, I feel as though I can take on anything.<br /><br /><br />

            Well, time has certainly flown by and it's now 13 days until I leave Nijmegen. I've tested 25 participants so far with 15 more scheduled, and at least one person signs up every day. There were a couple days where I was a bit worried that I may have to take some extra steps to find participants but that won't be the case, fortunately. <br /><br />I've been very much on my own here in the Netherlands, so the experiment really has been my baby of sorts. The results and the successes or failures contained within will be largely my responsibility, which makes me quite proud of it but also quite nervous! I'm excited to see how everything looks when I return, and to see what everyone else has been finding. <br /><br />Later today I'm heading to Amsterdam to stay with some friends I made a couple years ago on my last trip through the city. It will be nice to see them again and to be in Amsterdam again. It's a very different place from Nijmegen, with all the great, good, bad and ugly that comes from being a major cosmo/metro-politan area. <br />

Pilar's research fascinated me the most because it is so true, but the idea never occurred to me before; she is researching the emotion of languages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is believed that one feels more emotion when using their L1. Therefore cursing or expressing feelings of love will create a stronger sensation when using ones primary language versus hearing or using the same words in ones L2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She tested her theory by showing participants a bunch of words on a screen all at once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the words were emotional words, and others were neutral words and she did this in participants L1 and L2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The participants tend to remember more emotional words (like love) than neutral words in their L1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So cool!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></font></font></p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Despite my <a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/2011/05/instant-noodles-instant-immersion.html">startling first experience
with Chinese immersion</a>, I've actually found that in many cases, it's
easy to get around Beijing with only a bit of pocket-guide Chinese
and a lot of gesturing. I actually want to advise against this
solution, however, for a few reasons:</p>
<ol><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Whipping out the pocket-Chinese
	book is an instant beacon screaming "I'm a tourist who is dying to
	part with his money! Please overcharge me for things!"</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Relying on gesture and quick
	vocabulary results in a lazy mindset about language learning. It
	rarely results in meaningful exchanges, and you're pretty
	unmotivated to remember the words you keep looking up.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Ordering from the picture menu
	gets old fast. Remember those days pointing to the chicken nuggets
	on the kids menu? Yeah, just like that.</p>
</li></ol>
Instead, it's important to put yourself
out on there on the ragged edge of your language abilities. A little
panic and embarrassment go a long way toward long-term memory
encoding. Learning is certainly modulated by motivation, and nothing
is more motivating than trying to describe what exactly butter is to
an unimpressed grocer...

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p class="MsoNormal">This week has been pretty exciting for both Lauren and I.
Actually, I guess I should clarify by saying that Wednesday was really exciting
for the two of us; the rest of the week has actually been quite typical. On
Wednesday, two very important events happened. First, we ran our final and 60<sup>th</sup>
participant (which I will not really talk too much about because Lauren is
planning to write about that) and second, we presented our projects to the lab
here. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Overall, I think that our presentation, which I will attempt
to post at the bottom of this post, went quite well. Afterwards, we were told that it was very good by
some of the lab members, so I am taking that to mean that it was in fact a good
presentation. However, we were lucky enough to have both Jorge and Jason here to
look over our presentation before we actually presented it in order to look for
any holes or confusing statements within it. They both leave for Norway at the
beginning of next week, though, so I am very happy that we presented this week
while we had them as a little bit of backup. Also, I felt quite comfortable
presenting in front of the lab here. There were many smiling faces, which
always make this process easier, and I genuinely felt as though everyone was
really hoping that we would do well, not that this does not occur back home,
but it was just something encouraging that I noticed in the moment here. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When actually starting to prepare a presentation here,
Lauren and I decided that doing one joint presentation made more sense than two
individual ones. Much of our information is identical, or at least similar, so
in order to avoid simply repeating ourselves, one presentation seemed to work
in our favor. However, this process of creating the presentation was really
easy because we each had our PowerPoint presentations from the meeting back in
April. It was really just a matter of making the flow a little smoother. The
one downside to our presentation, however, was that we couldn't really show any
eye-tracking data because we have been running so many participants so
frequently. In addition, any data that we would be showing would just be about
monolinguals, so it really would not help to prove or disprove a lot about the
English-Spanish bilinguals. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the whole, I think that everyone was very happy with what
we provided and very impressed with the PIRE program. One of the points that we
wanted to be sure to make was the significance of the PIRE program and what
exactly it allows us to do because many of the people here did not quite
understand why we were here. Honestly, though, it is quite a unique experience,
so chances are that most students at American universities would not really
understand it as well.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/PIRE%20Presentation.pptx" style="text-decoration: underline; ">PIRE Presentation.pptx</a></p>

at Beijing Normal University (BNU), I am replicating tests of knowledge, language
processing, executive function and theory of mind that we have used at Penn
State. This requires many more changes than simply translating the materials.
Let's begin with recruitment. At Penn State, we send letters of consent home
with the children who qualify for the study at the preschools on campus (The
Bennett Center and The Child Development Lab). At BNU, we have been recruiting
participants by having Dr. Taomei Guo hand out flyers to professors and friends
who have young children. This cultural difference is telling of how things
operate in each location. In regards to adapting the theory of mind task, we
have borrowed the Chinese script from Wellman &amp; Liu (2004) with their
permission. They have changed the names of the toy people to ones that are
culturally appropriate (e.g. Peter to Dongdong) and also changed the items used
(e.g. crayon box to potato chip tube). The fast mapping task is used as a
processing based measure and it tests the child's ability to "map" novel words
to novel objects. The first changes were made to the familiar objects. After
consulting with a graduate student from Beijing (at Penn State), we replaced
block and marker with book and shoe. Next, we got help in creating Chinese
non-words.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Almost exactly a year ago, I had the
privilege of visiting Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA) to learn
about their functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system.
fNIRS has existed as a neuroimaging tool for over 15 years, but only
recently has it come to the forefront as a major opportunity for
research in cognitive neuroscience, and as specifically a tool for
psycholinguistic studies. fNIRS offers the distinct advantages of
relative silence and motion insensitivity, permitting speech
comprehension and production while undergoing a scan. Like fMRI, it
also offers spatial localization of hemodynamic activity, but
measuring at considerably higher speeds. A year later, here at
Beijing Normal University (literally half a world away), I have had
my second chance to work in fNIRS research.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p class="MsoNormal">As I alluded to last week, I have taken it upon myself to
write some instructions for the scoring processes of both the Language
Proficiency Tests and the Lexical Decision Tasks. After discussing everything
with both Lauren and Giuli, I began to realize that it will be very easy to
simply forget the systems that I have been using this summer when we all return
in the fall. I am happy to say that I have finished writing some pretty
detailed instructions for both of these, but it was definitely not easy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Probably the worst part about creating these documents was
the amount of detail that I had to put into each step. I think that this was
perhaps the most important part of the whole writing process because I know
that if there are any gaps in these documents, it may be difficult to go
through them in the future. While this may not be the worst thing possible and
could probably be figured out, I think that these documents will cut down on a
lot of extra explaining and relearning. As promised, though, anyone looking to
score anything and who has used similar programs are welcome to ask me for
these. Even though it takes a while to read through everything, I think that it
is a pretty easy process to master overall. Once you get in the swing of
things, you can almost do it with your eyes closed (I would not suggest
actually doing this however).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, this week has been quite fruitful in terms of
research. Every day this week, Lauren and I have been running quite a few
participants, even though their semesters are winding down right now. And we
have definitely seen the effects of the end of the semester difficulties;
yesterday, we had four participants cancel on us. Luckily, though, we had two
participants get two of their friends to come on the spot today, which sort of
made everything even (more of mentally even, though--not numerically). But
overall, I think that we will hit our goal for participant recruitment by the
end of next week. Now we just need to hope that people show up for us!</p>

            As I described in my last post, it certainly took a long time to start actually running participants, but this week it finally happened. At last, empirical confirmation that I am indeed here with a reason and a purpose, and at halfway through my stay it was not a moment too late!<br /><br />I had four subjects this week - all women, a bit probability-defying. Everything went smoothly, at least from my perspective. <br /><br />Radboud University operates a webpage called the Sona Research Participation System which is what I've been exclusively using to recruit people. It's very well-designed, you can add your study to the list of ones being advertised and subjects-in-waiting can peruse it at their leisure and sign up for a certain timeslot. I've had it advertised for one week now and I've already had 25 people sign up, so I'm quite confident I'll reach the goal of 40 within the next four weeks. :-) I've not had any 'no-shows' thus far, and I don't believe that trend will stop, either. <br />
