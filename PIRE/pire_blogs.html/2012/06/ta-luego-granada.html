I have indeed missed writing to you. It's been a crazy past two weeks and I can't
wait to tell you all about it now. As I write this, I am sitting in <i>la sala de becarios</i> (the grad
student/people on scholarship work room) tying up any and all loose ends before
tomorrow, when my time here ends and I set sail for my post-PIRE Europe travels.
Looking back on the past eight weeks, I can't believe it's already my last day
working at the University. I am definitely going to miss hiking the big old hill
to the University every morning to work alongside all my friends and colleagues
here in the department. But what I might miss most from my daily routine here is
ordering my morning <i>tostada mista</i> y <i>café con leche y hielo (toast with jam/jelly
and coffee with milk and ice) </i>&nbsp;from
my friend Antonio, who works at the cafeteria on campus. All nostalgia aside,
this final leg of my journey in Granada has been as fun as it was productive,
and now it's time for the day-by-day breakdown of this final leg of my journey
in Granada. If you want to learn more about how my research has progressed and
what new things I've learned about Spanish culture, read on!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday June 5 -Today I had a participant to run in the
afternoon. But I spent the rest of my day at the University with my eyes glued
to my laptop screen. I wouldn't have it any other way! Amelia, Clair, Sara, and
I were scheduled to present our work to the department the following morning,
so I spent the day analyzing my data and putting my presentation together. Before
I go on, I would like to take a moment to extend a big thanks to my Penn State
graduate student mentors Alvaro and Amelia for helping me navigate my data and
make sense of it all. It was with their help that I was able to get my bearings
and finalize my Powerpoint presentation. &nbsp;After having finished preparing my presentation,
Amelia and I met with Teresa Bajo (head of our department) to touch base with
her and quickly brief her on our presentation. Thanks to Dr. Bajo's help, we
were well-equipped and ready to go for the following day. After work that
night, Clair, Sara, Amelia, and I worked on merging together our separate
presentations into one so that everything would run smoothly and coherently
come presentation time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday June 6 -&nbsp; I
woke up early today so I could eat a good hearty breakfast at the University
before my presentation. Now that I am friends with most of our colleagues in
the department, I wasn't as nervous as I expected myself to be. I also found
that I wasn't nervous about presenting in Spanish &nbsp;(perhaps a good sign that immersion has taken
its effect?).However, what did put me a bit out of my comfort zone was the
question and answer after the presentation. This was a bit harder for me to
conquer than the presentation itself just because a lot of people talking at
once in your second language (and with an Andalucian accent) is understandably
challenging. But, like in all situations where I encounter language
miscommunication, I just had to ask for clarification before answering their
questions and <i>no pasa nada</i>
(everything was okay). Looking back, I think I could have done a more thorough
job explaining my graphs. To an audience of linguists, I think my explanation
would have sufficed because the material is more familiar. But because the
department is made of mainly psychologists, not linguists, I should have spent
more time explaining my variables and what was really happening with my graphs
so that everyone could understand it. Other than that, I am really pleased with
how our presentation went! Having only one participant later in the evening, I
was left with a free afternoon. I spent a little time at the University using
the wifi to contact participants also to continue familiarizing myself with the
programs we use to analyze data. Then I headed back to <i>el centro</i> (the city center) because today was the <i>Tarasca</i>. La Tarasca is the pagan parade
that takes place every year on the Wednesday of the Feria. But what is La
Feria, you ask? It is fundamentally a sacred week that honors the city's patron
saint. But with each passing year, it becomes more and more a liberal,
party-going, week-long celebration with lights lit above all the streets and a
carnival-fair type park set up with booths and rides just outside the city. But
to return to la Tarasca, it was basically a short parade full of bellydancers
dancing, big Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand puppets walking, marching band
music playing, and colored confetti falling from every balcony. While it was a
short parade, I have never seen the streets so packed. It's a wonderful thing to
see the community come together to celebrate. After the parade, I went back to
the apartment because the other Penn State PIRE becarios and I had decided to host
a family-style dinner for our Granadino friends. We spent the day cleaning the
apartment top to bottom, planning the menu, and grocery shopping. Then Clair
and I went to the University because we had a participant scheduled for the
evening. After eating ourselves silly at our family dinner, the whole group of
us went to la Feria. As I mentioned before, the Feria is a big carnival style festival
in the campo (in the parts outside the city) with booths, rides, and tent
restaurants. I rode a tacky haunted house ride and the bumper cars. I'm not
sure if Spaniards are more competitive when it comes to carnival rides or if
someone was just out to get me, but all I remember is one extremely rowdy bumper
car barreling towards me and the next thing I know I wasn't in my car anymore.
I was on the ground. Flung like a ragdoll. I guess seatbelts are required on
park rides at the Feria? But don't worry, I'm still in one piece! But indeed,
it was quite the adrenaline rush. Well anyways, on your next trip to Granada,
remember that you've been warned about the bumper cars at la Feria. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:
minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;
mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Wingdings">J</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday June 7 - The University was closed Thursday and
Friday due to the Feria. I took advantage of my day to take care of some work.
As usual, I went to work recruiting participants via email. While I did my laundry,
I turned on the TV and to my surprise, I found Spanish-dubbed Desperate
Housewives. It made me feel like I was back at home! During the night I tried <i>arachina</i> for the first time with my friend
and colleague from the lab, Francesco. Being Italian, he told me it is a type
of Italian food I must try before leaving Europe. It turns the guy knows his
food! The arachina was like a little hot pocket filled with rice and peas and
chicken and sauce. Pretty good. I went to bed early because I had an early bus
to catch in the morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday June 8 - I woke up at 6am to catch my 8am bus to Cádiz,
a beautiful city in south-western Andalucía. In short, Cádiz
was my favorite city in Andalucía (after Granada of course) mainly for
its beautiful coast, it's small town feel, and the sweet people I met. To
summarize, I ate shark for the first time and I also ordered a plate of the
famous regional plato <i>pescaito frito</i>
(fried fish). I caught some rays at la Caleta beach and wandered over to
explore the rest of Cádiz's stunning coast. Because I made friends with a boy
from France and a girl from Italy, my brain was in language absorption overload
by the time I went to bed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday June 9 - After spending the day in Cádiz,
I headed off to Sevilla, as it is en route to Granada from Cadiz (when you are
taking the bus). My friend from home is studying there for the summer, so he
showed me around the city. We took a walk by the Guadalquivir river and he
showed me some of his favorite nooks and crannies. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday June 10 -Sunday morning when I woke up, almost
everything was closed. But there was a religious procession going on in the
barrios (the neighborhoods) that morning, so I got to see some the church
members carrying la hostia (the body of Christ) on a float through the street.
It was like a mini neighborhood version of the Corpus Christi. But I was saddened
to realize that due to this religious holiday, the great Cathedral of Sevilla
(the largest Gothic Church in all the Iberian Peninsula) was closed. But luckily
there was a loophole: if you attend mass you can get in. So, after mass, I
walked around the church grounds and came across the tomb of none other than Christopher
Colombus. To be honest, I expected his tomb to be bigger, but then again,
anything would seem unimportant in comparison to La Catedral de Sevilla is. Later,
we walked to Plaza Espana, Sevilla's biggest plaza. Its claim to fame are its beautifully
decorated plaques that honor each of the autonomous communities of Spain. After
this touristy stop, I was in the mood to cool off and relax (Sevilla is so hot
at this time of the year). So, we went to Park María Luisa to play in fountains.
Before catching my bus home, my friend and I cooked dinner at my hostel with some
friends that we made. The Eurocup was on, so the atmosphere was lively to say
the least. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday June 11 - Today I had a full schedule. I ran three
participants. So from the research perspective, we had a very productive day at
the lab! Por la noche, I went to San Miguel Alta, the viewpoint with the
highest altitude in all of Granada proper. It was quite humbling to see the
city from so high up, but my favorite <i>mirador</i>
(viewpoint) is still San Nicholas in Albayzin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday June 12 - Today, in the morning, Clair and I
stumbled upon a new park where we can exercise. It had tons of machines and
trails to play on. It was a bit curious though because we were the only young people
there. Let it be known that the elderly of Granada really do seem to take care
of their health. I hope to follow suit! I also found it curious that they don't
wear exercise clothes to exercise. They wear slacks and work shirts, so we
stuck out like sore American thumbs with our exercise pants and tanktops! We
had a participant in the late afternoon today, and after working at the lab for
an hour or so, we went home for a family dinner night at the <i>piso</i> (apartment). I tried (and failed
miserably) at cooking salmorejo, which I had eaten in Cordoba and loved. I
thought it would be quick and easy, so I invited some of our Spanish friends
and colleagues from the lab to join us. But alas, I cannot follow a recipe and
instead of adding two <i>teeth</i> of
garlic, I put in two <i>heads</i>. But the
failed dinner aside, we still enjoyed great company!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Wednesday June 13 - Clair
and I had a 9am participant in the morning and Melissa and Alvaro presented
their work to the lab group. They did a great job explaining their work and it
was nice for me to get a formal update on what is happening with their
experiments and data. After their presentations, I went to Playa Salobreña
with Clair and Melissa. This is by far my favorite beach in Granada. I like it
because it's got a breathtaking view of the white-washed town, a castle on the
hill off in the distance, and a rock that you can climb that looks out over the
ocean. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday June 14 - Today was a day for chores. Because I had
no participants, I spent the day cleaning the apartment and buying some of
those last-minute things that I've been putting off ever since I got here. I
bought a cd of traditional flamenco music, some more Granadino clothing, and a
whole bunch of other keepsakes. Later that night, Clair dyed my hair black. Although
I thought this <i>morena</i> (dark-haired
girl) disguise would make me blend in more with the people of Granada, they
still call me <i>rubia rubia</i> (blondie,
light haired girl!) when I walk down the street. I guess you can take a girl
from Pennsylvania but you can't take the Pennsylvania from the girl. Tonight Spain
had a Eurocup match with Ireland I believe, so I went for tapas with my friend
Hana to watch the game and soak up some futbol frenzy. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday June 15 - For this weekend, my plan was to see the
small town of Ronda and the weird English colony of Gibraltar. I left for Ronda
at 6:50am and spent my time climbing the rocks, playing in waterfalls, and admiring
the feats of ancient engineering that are the bridges of Ronda. It was a
whirlwind of sightseeing, but it was like nothing I had ever experienced before
(I'll have to post pictures). Then during late afternoon, I left Ronda for
Gibraltar. To say the least, Gibraltar is interesting. Despite the big signs
saying PASSORT CONTROL IMPORTANT, passport control is a joke. I walked from the
Spanish side to the English side and the police officer didn't even glance at
the passport in my hand. Tonight was an annual Gibraltarian festival that
celebrates all the different cultures in the colony. It centered on a
Gibraltarian pastry called the Catalina (I wouldn't recommend it unless you
like the consistency of paper mache). But there were fireworks and good Indian
food. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:
minor-latin;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Wingdings">J</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday June 16 - Today I took the cable car up the rock
(really, it's a mountain, but the locals call it the rock) to see 1) the native
monkeys that live there and walk around and jump on you 2) St. Michael's Caves,
which is beautiful with its dripping stalagmite forms and 3) the War Tunnels,
where the English soldiers lived for three years to defend the military base
from the Spanish during the Great Siege. After that, I spent a quiet evening
enjoying Main Street and I called it a night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday June 17 - I got up early today and had a big English
breakfast at the Ocean Village port in Gibraltar with my friend Eva. After
eating, I made the trek to <i>la frontera</i>
(the border between Spain and Gibraltar), ran to and almost missed the bus to
Algeciras, and from there bought my ticket back home to Granada. After
unpacking and resting a little, I grabbed dinner at a sushi place (a sushi
place in Spain...who knew!?) with Clair and Sara. Then, of course, I went to an
Internet café so that I could call and message my dad and grandpap to wish them
a HAPPY FATHER'S DAY! &nbsp;I then took a walk
to the mirador San Nicholas in Albayzin to enjoy the view. With the view from
this mirador, nothing in life can be too bad.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday June 18 - Today we had a participant scheduled, but
he had to cancel due to an emergency. So I spent the day taking care of chores
around the house and trying to re-email any participants that showed any
interest at all in participating in my study. Now, if you remember from my
first blog, I borrowed Alvaro's mother's flamenco dress for Dia de la Cruz at
the beginning of May. Well, my trip here ends soon, so I thought it best to
return it pronto. Once I got to his house, his mom invited me to stay for
dinner and watch the Spain-Croatia match with them and some friends. Amongst
other tipical Spanish tapas, we ate dates with bacon, salmorejo (with the proper
amount of garlic this time), croquettes, and shrimp. After the game, I got to
listen in on some Spanish political discussion. It was great fun and
comprehensive L2 input to boot. I left full and happy, and with some new futbol-watching
vocabulary phrases to put in my notebook!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday - I spent today checking in with participants,
trying to secure a few final ones before my time here in Granada ends. Then
Alvaro, Clair, and I spent the evening at the lab going through all our data to
make sure we had everything where it should be. Then we had to go through and
make sure each of our bags has all the necessary research equipment - to make
sure we don't leave any pieces of the equipment behind! On the way home from
the University, Clair and I grabbed a tapa, something we're sure to miss back
in the states. Once back at the apartment, we went to town cleaning. As of July
2<sup>nd</sup>, the place is no longer ours so we had to make sure everything
was spotless and looking like it did the first day we got here. Check!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday - Today Clair and I went to the University early
in the morning to finish up some last bit of work. We wanted to go through each
file one by one and make sure everything was there one more time. We
consolidated all of our data from all the lab booths onto our hard drives and
personal computers. We then went through and made sure our handwritten participant
sheets matched the data we have. In the end, we have run thirty-six
participants (yay!), everything looks great with the data, and we can't wait to
start analyzing all that we've collected here. In terms of my upcoming
departure from Granada, my friend Sara from home came to meet me in Granada today
so that we could travel through Europe together. Although today was a whirlwind
of packing, planning, cleaning, and working, it was all worth it come nighttime:
we PIRE researchers planned a goodbye party with our friends from the lab so
that we could see everyone one last time before leaving. I couldn't imagine a
better ending.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday June 21 - Early in the morning today I leave
Granada for a ten day trip to San Sebastian, Paris, and Rome. My plan? Enjoy
some culinary genius in Spain's most talked-about beach city in the northern Basque
region (San Sebastian), stroll on by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and oogle at
Rome's famous Trevi Fountain. I must admit I am feeling a bit nostalgic about
leaving Granada, as it is now my second home. But I should think the road ahead
will also bring unforgettable adventures, so I can't be too sad!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As always, thank you for taking the time to read my blog. If
you have any questions or comments about my trip, my work, the city, or <i>any</i> of my experiences here in Spain at
all- please ask (I assure you I will never tire of talking about my summer
here). Until then, 'ta luego!</p>
