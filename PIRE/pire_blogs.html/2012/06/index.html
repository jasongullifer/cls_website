            It's really hard to believe that I've been doing research for three weeks already and by next week it'll be July. It feels like my time here is going by too fast and makes me here I could stay here longer and keep doing research.<br /><br />My first week here was kinda slow as all I was doing was testing scripts. However, by the second week things really got busy as I started running participants from 9 to 5 each day. We started with native Chinese speakers so we could get an idea of the general ability of native speakers to distinguish between falling and rising tones. The next step is going to be recruiting foreign students here at BNU. Considering the amount of foreigners I see on campus every day, this shouldn't be too hard.<br /><br />One thing I had originally planned to be doing was recruiting both native English and native Korean speakers. However, I recently learned from Professor Shu that they had previously run Korean participants on my same ERP task, and they showed no MMN. Needless to say, we're now probably not going to be running Korean participants, and I've also been spending this past week reading up on whether looking for a P3 response would be better in addition to MMN.<br /><br />Besides my research, I've been enjoying working with the grad students here at BNU. I'm grateful that they're willing to speak Chinese with me instead of English. I attended a seminar today on ERP methods that was entirely in Chinese. There was a lot I couldn't understand, but I'm impressed with how much my listening comprehension has improved while I'm here. As I've said before, I'm really going to miss this level of immersion. It makes me want to attend grad school here in China so I could finally become fluent in the language.<br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            As I've lived in China these past few weeks, there's two things I've consistently noticed. The first is that my favorite experiences in China haven't been the sights I've seen or the food I've eaten, but the people I've met. Meeting people at the youth hostels I stayed at and interacting with the graduate students here at Beijing Normal University as given me a new appreciation for travel and its ability to help break people out of their shell. I would consider myself a pretty shy person most of the time, but I feel that China has definitely helped me become more social. And nothing has helped me connect with people here in China than being able to speak their native language.<br /><br />Which brings me to the second thing I noticed while I've been in China. I was previously nervous about traveling on my own in China because I felt that my Chinese wouldn't be good enough, but I've been consistently amazed not only by how it's better than I thought it was, but also by how fast it's improved by only being here for five weeks. When I first arrived I could barely understand what people were saying. Now I can have full conversations. Although I have noticed that my listening ability is still the aspect of my Chinese I need to improve on the most, and I've made it a goal to be able to have a full conversation without asking people to repeat themselves by the time I leave China. I also thought that I would have to speak English with the graduate students at BNU, as it turns out, I mainly just speak Chinese with them. I remember how last summer in Shanghai, I would get exhausted from speaking Chinese for a prolonged period of time. Now I can speak Chinese without feeling anymore tired than I do when I speak English. All in all, I'm going to miss the level of immersion that I get while I'm in China.<br /><br />And I feel that I first had these revelations while I was in Chengdu.<br /><br />I left Xi'an for Chengdu with my mind filled with plans to see pandas and go hiking in mountains in the area. I had also heard that Chengdu was known in China as a very laid-back city, with good food, and cool people, but these were mainly an afterthought. As it turns out, I didn't do any sight-seeing at all in Chengdu. I didn't see any pandas or go hiking. But I really don't care just because of the people I met there.<br /><br />When I arrived at my youth hostel in Chengdu, I was hungry and wanted to try some of Chengdu's famous spicy hot pot. Not wanting to eat alone, I asked some random Chinese people in the courtyard of my hostel if they wanted to go eat hot pot. I ended up spending the whole week hanging out with them.<br /><br />We would walk around the area together, go to bars, go sing karaoke, and each day I kept putting off my plans to go see pandas or go hiking. We would have long discussions about our lives in each of our home countries and cultural differences. And I spoke mainly Chinese the entire time. By Thursday, we ended up deciding to spend three days at a person's apartment in a nearby city with no sights whatsoever. And all we did was just hang out. But I didn't care because it was just thrilling being able to connect with people so fast.<br /><br />When I left Chengdu for Beijing, I promised to my new friends that i would come visit them in Shanghai (and I did, but that's a later blog post). I also decided that I would have to return to Chengdu at some point to actually see pandas and go hiking like I planned. But again, I had no regrets over just hanging out for the past several days because of the people I met. By the time I returned to Beijing, I was exhausted from the past two weeks. But I would also say that I had made the most of the two weeks I traveled on my own while in China.<br />

write this. Allow me to set the scene: my apartment is about half a mile from
the campus of Beijing Normal University, in a pleasant neighborhood called
"Xiao Xi Tian" - which means something like "little western
paradise". Small shops with their wares spilling out the door line both
sides of the street. Vendors sell fried tofu and boiled meats on skewers from
their bike carts parked under trees, and give discounts to Westerners with
little Mandarin. Middle-aged men sit in circles on folding chairs on the
sidewalk playing cards until the sun rises or the rain falls on their game.
Each morning I walk from Xiao Xi Tian down Xingjiekou street, past an open air
fruit market (taking care to dodge the watermelons tossed from a curbside truck
into the upturned arms of the aproned proprietor), past the plaza where elderly
men and women practice Tai Chi, hopping lightly from one foot to another while
thrusting with surprising force a short sword with a red tassel dangling from
the hilt, and through the intersection where traffic lights hang uselessly as
trucks, buses, compacts and electric bicycles converge with great speed and
furious honking and somehow reemerge following new paths and with no visible
damage. This is China, where the rules are a little different, dogs walk off
the leash, and a half-liter of coke goes for 50 cents on the street.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

ear. Or whatever made me violently ill following a dinner of many dishes last
week. Have I seen the wall yet? Yes. Have I walked on a 2200 year old section
of it? Yes. Have I taken a photograph of the photograph of Mao Zedong at
Tiananmen Square. Yes. Have I learned any Mandarin? I know my numbers, and use
a lot of deictic gesture combined with French or Spanish or whatever else
bubbles up from my reservoir of foreign language fragments. What's the most
difficult thing to get used to in China? Probably the feeling of being a roving
zoo exhibit. Or the looks of surprise when it turns out I can use chop sticks

me Mandarin and run my participants and take me places to buy towels and shower
sandals and umbrellas without lace (parasols are the Uggs of China and are
easily mistaken for functional anti-rain gear). They enjoy watching online
videos, gchatting, and taking breaks to eat ice cream. They have as many
questions about America as I have about China, and often know more about US
geography than I do (although, in my own defense as a Midwesterner, the value
of differentiating one big cornfield from another is dubious). We spend our
days together in a hot office sitting at cubicles in the wash of tiny
alternating fans, reading papers and cursing Excel or E-Prime. We eat lunch
together in the cafeteria, which has four levels, meals for under a dollar, and
chefs who will happily quarter, slice and plate huge water melons for a short
but never shrinking line of people.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

may hear from me again soon, perhaps about the data I'm analyzing, or the food
I'm eating, or the places I'm walking to. For those interested in what China is
really like (and not simply the American stereotype, which I can tell you is
wrong in nearly every way) you should listen to the most recent episode of This

            ...because it has rained non-stop for four days. The rainy weather interrupted Midsummer celebrations, so Emma and I did not have the opportunity to take part in eating salted herring and dancing merrily around the maypole (I'm not too upset about the herring). It is our final week in Sweden and the rainy days indoors have given me much time to reflect upon our seven weeks in Lund and all of the cliches about learning about oneself and one's own country through traveling abroad. When I arrived in Sweden I was so excited to live in a different place with different customs, a different language, and different people. I am so thankful that I've had the opportunity to meet all of the wonderful people in Lund. I have learned so much about research, navigating a foreign country and foreign university, and just being an American abroad. The experience has been truly invaluable, and I will never forget my time here. All that aside, I cannot wait to return to the U.S. just in time for 4th of July!

            I had to chosen to visit Xi'an for several reasons. For one, it's the home of the famous Terracotta Warriors. Secondly, it is one of the Four Ancient Capitals of China and as a history major, I was especially interested in checking out this city. My train arrived in Xi'an around noon and as soon as I had arrived at my youth hostel, I had already met fascinating people. One was Chris, who was surgeon currently in residency and was in China and previously Mongolia in order to teach surgical techniques in rural areas. We spent the evening when I first arrived in Xi'an talking and the guy was fascinating conversation. Afterwards, there was a dumpling-making party where we got to meet everyone else who was staying at the hostel, and they each had fascinating stories. By the evening, we had already made plans for tomorrow and putting it mildly, it was going to be a busy day.<br /><br />We started the day by waking up early and seeing the Terracotta Warriors. It's weird, when I planned to return to China, I was more excited about seeing the Forbidden City, but the Terracotta Warriors ended up being more interesting. You can read that it was an entire army buried with the first emperor of China in order to guard him in the afterlife. But the sheer scale of it doesn't really hit you until you see the huge excavation pits, and you think about how long it must have taken to excavate the army. And the fact that it's still ongoing. And the insane amount of detail on the faces of the soldiers. And when you realize that something of this size had been completely forgotten from history and likely would still be unknown to this day if some farmer in the 1970s had tried digging a well one day. In short, it was incredible.<br /><br />After that, we had some time in the afternoon to explore the Muslim Quarter of Xi'an. My friend, Chris, was mainly interested in how the street was perfect for photography. I was mainly interested in the cheap and delicious food. Afterwards, we got on a train with some French friends of ours we had met at the youth hostel for what would prove to be the climax of my time in Xi'an: an overnight hike to Huangshan, one of the five holiest mountains of China.<br /><br />As we rode a taxi to the base of Huangshan at 10 PM, I asked the taxi driver how much people he would expect there to be on the mountain at this time. He replied a lot. Thinking I misheard him, I figured there couldn't possibly be that many people on the mountain at this time. Before we began our hike, we got dinner at a local restaurant and coincidentally, had an hour-long conversation about language, how culture and experiences with people are what truly motivate people to learn a language, and if a person can ever be considered truly fluent in a language. Afterwards, we began our hike up Huangshan which would last all night.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about Huangshan was that it was absolutely beautiful at night. Even in the dark, I could see why it had been immortalized in Chinese paintings and poetry for centuries. The second thing I noticed was that I had not misheard the cab driver. It really was crowded at night. Nothing gives a better picture of just how much people China has when you actually have to wait in line for over thirty minutes at 2 AM just to ascend further up a damn mountain. By the time we reached the summit at 4 AM, we were completely exhausted. But it was completely worth it when we saw the sunrise. Never in my life have I seen a more beautiful sunrise. Afterwards, we rode a cable car down and arrived back at the hostel around noon, where I promptly slept for the rest of the day.<br /><br />When I woke up the next day, I realized that I had seen all I could possibly want to see in Xi'an. However, I still had nearly a week left until I had to be back in Beijing to start my research. So that same day, I got another overnight train ticket to the city of Chengdu.<br />

            So, I'd like to apologize in advance for making my first blog entry so late. It's just that these past few weeks in China have been amazing. This is the beginning of my third week in Beijing doing research, but actually the fifth week I've been in China. I decided to do some traveling on my own for two weeks before I started my research. And I can honestly say that those two weeks were some of the best weeks in my life.<br /><br />So, I arrived in Beijing on May 28th of Memorial Day weekend and I checked into a youth hostel I would stay at for a few days until I would leave for Xi'an. When my flight arrived in Beijing at midnight, I was disoriented and kinda nervous about being in China on my own. But those fears disappeared by the next day when I was able to explore the neighborhood outside my youth hostel. You see, this wasn't my first time in China. I had previously studied abroad in Shanghai last summer. And honestly, it's a cool feeling just being able to walk along the street and take in the sights, and listen to people speaking a language that you're not fluent in. I experienced that a lot in Shanghai and that feeling quickly came back once I was in Beijing.<br /><br />While I was in Beijing, I took one day to just get accustomed to being back in China. I spent another day meeting up with Benjamin Zinszer, a graduate student who I've worked closely with for the past year, and Tim Poepsel, another graduate student who is also in China on a PIRE grant. The next day, I first went to a site I had wanted to see for many years: The Forbidden City. Walking in an enormous palace that for centuries had been the home of emperors and had been closed off to commoners on penalty of death was an incredible experience. I also had time that evening to see the Temple of Heaven, where the emperor would pray every year in a ceremony for good harvests that was forbidden to be observed by commoners. However, as I said before, I only planned to be in Beijing for a few days. After all, I would have two whole months to explore Beijing. So that same evening, I boarded an overnight train to the city of Xi'an.<br />

            As a bit of a self-proclaimed language nerd, when I landed in Sweden (well, technically Copenhagen) I had this crazy idea that, at the end of my 8 weeks in Lund, I'd have a pretty solid foundation in Swedish. Then I actually heard the language and all hopes went out the window. Thing is, with the prevalence of English in the Swedes' everyday life and the fact that Skåne (the southernmost region of Sweden) is surprisingly diverse, it actually took quite a while for me to be able to differentiate spoken Swedish from the mix of other languages. The realization that the Swedish vowel system was beyond my grasp was a bit more instantaneous. <br /><br />On our first night together in Lund an incredible 7 weeks ago, Beth and I decided to go for a walk around the city to try to get our bearings. Beth made the fateful mistake of trusting me with directions and I got us sufficiently lost. It was on our adventure home that Beth and I had our first taste of the Swedish vowels, for our inability to pronounce 'Norra Fälladen' (the name of our neighborhood) yielded countless corrections from those we had asked for directions. For some, the [ä] was elongated, for others it sounded rhotic, and for a few it sounded downright made-up. While each interaction may have brought us closer to home, they brought us progressively farther away from any hold that we had on the language. <br /><br />During the first month, I spend quite a bit of energy trying to auditorily differentiate the Swedish vowels only to realize, time and time again, that it just wasn't going to happen. Lund is your quintessential (Swedish) college town and, as such, the swirl of accents makes if nearly impossible to pinpoint a single "standard" version of the vowels and rendered my attempts nearly hopeless. Still determined to learn some Swedish, I opted to switch to trying to understand written Swedish and, right off the bat, things seemed to be going much more smoothly! But then I heard the spoken equivalents and it was right back to square 1. Ok, to be fair, it was more like square 1.5, but I was still completely lost. How is it that the /sju/ in 'Universitetssjuhuset' is pronounced as [swi]? Or that the /kyr/ in 'Allhelgonakyrkan' is pronounced as [<b>∫</b>ir] while the /ka/ is just that, yet the /ka/ in 'Kämnasrätten' is more of a [<b>∫</b><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">ɛ]??<br /><br />For the</span> past week or so, my life has been consumed by coding, sound files, and countless "huh?!?"s. Helloooo Swedish Boston Nmaing Task. Aside from the tasks specific to my experimental question, my participants run the gauntlet of your usual smattering of behavioral tasks: Flanker, Language History Questionnaire, Operation Span, and (my personal favorite) the Boston Naming Task in both L1 and L2.<br /><br />Coding the L2 (English) is a breeze, and to be perfectly honest, it can actually be rather amusing - one participant, unable to produce the English word 'scroll,' jubilantly cried 'Torah!!!' But coding the English Boston Naming Task (as least for the first few participants) was just an introduction to my foray with the Swedish BNT. Weeks earlier, I went through and translated all of the English words into Swedish in preparation for the actual coding and, in doing so, I started pronouncing the words in my head to the typical soundtrack of, "ok, so this will sound like ____, and this will be more of a _____." Nope, wrong. All wrong. <br /><br />The first time I played through one of the Swedish sound files, I perched in front of my computer, fingers on the keys and ready to transcribe, but by word #10, I sat there dumbfounded. I kept thinking to myself, "no, there's no way! You can't honestly tell me that that string of consonants makes THAT sound!" After 1 or 2 more loops through the sound file, I actually felt confident enough to begin typing and, surprisingly enough, things started to fall into place. Aside from the dialectal differences with vowels, I actually began to grasp the orthographic mappings of Swedish phonemes and, while I would never venture to say that I could speak the language, should you ever find yourself in a bind and NEED to know the Swedish word for 'octopus,' I got you. It's 'blackfisk.'<span class="ipa"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

            <p class="MsoNormal">Hello all! It's been a while since I last wrote and I apologize!
I have indeed missed writing to you. It's been a crazy past two weeks and I can't
wait to tell you all about it now. As I write this, I am sitting in <i>la sala de becarios</i> (the grad
student/people on scholarship work room) tying up any and all loose ends before
tomorrow, when my time here ends and I set sail for my post-PIRE Europe travels.
Looking back on the past eight weeks, I can't believe it's already my last day
working at the University. I am definitely going to miss hiking the big old hill
to the University every morning to work alongside all my friends and colleagues
here in the department. But what I might miss most from my daily routine here is
ordering my morning <i>tostada mista</i> y <i>café con leche y hielo (toast with jam/jelly
and coffee with milk and ice) </i>&nbsp;from
my friend Antonio, who works at the cafeteria on campus. All nostalgia aside,
this final leg of my journey in Granada has been as fun as it was productive,
and now it's time for the day-by-day breakdown of this final leg of my journey
in Granada. If you want to learn more about how my research has progressed and
what new things I've learned about Spanish culture, read on!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday June 5 -Today I had a participant to run in the
afternoon. But I spent the rest of my day at the University with my eyes glued
to my laptop screen. I wouldn't have it any other way! Amelia, Clair, Sara, and
I were scheduled to present our work to the department the following morning,
so I spent the day analyzing my data and putting my presentation together. Before
I go on, I would like to take a moment to extend a big thanks to my Penn State
graduate student mentors Alvaro and Amelia for helping me navigate my data and
make sense of it all. It was with their help that I was able to get my bearings
and finalize my Powerpoint presentation. &nbsp;After having finished preparing my presentation,
Amelia and I met with Teresa Bajo (head of our department) to touch base with
her and quickly brief her on our presentation. Thanks to Dr. Bajo's help, we
were well-equipped and ready to go for the following day. After work that
night, Clair, Sara, Amelia, and I worked on merging together our separate
presentations into one so that everything would run smoothly and coherently
come presentation time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday June 6 -&nbsp; I
woke up early today so I could eat a good hearty breakfast at the University
before my presentation. Now that I am friends with most of our colleagues in
the department, I wasn't as nervous as I expected myself to be. I also found
that I wasn't nervous about presenting in Spanish &nbsp;(perhaps a good sign that immersion has taken
its effect?).However, what did put me a bit out of my comfort zone was the
question and answer after the presentation. This was a bit harder for me to
conquer than the presentation itself just because a lot of people talking at
once in your second language (and with an Andalucian accent) is understandably
challenging. But, like in all situations where I encounter language
miscommunication, I just had to ask for clarification before answering their
questions and <i>no pasa nada</i>
(everything was okay). Looking back, I think I could have done a more thorough
job explaining my graphs. To an audience of linguists, I think my explanation
would have sufficed because the material is more familiar. But because the
department is made of mainly psychologists, not linguists, I should have spent
more time explaining my variables and what was really happening with my graphs
so that everyone could understand it. Other than that, I am really pleased with
how our presentation went! Having only one participant later in the evening, I
was left with a free afternoon. I spent a little time at the University using
the wifi to contact participants also to continue familiarizing myself with the
programs we use to analyze data. Then I headed back to <i>el centro</i> (the city center) because today was the <i>Tarasca</i>. La Tarasca is the pagan parade
that takes place every year on the Wednesday of the Feria. But what is La
Feria, you ask? It is fundamentally a sacred week that honors the city's patron
saint. But with each passing year, it becomes more and more a liberal,
party-going, week-long celebration with lights lit above all the streets and a
carnival-fair type park set up with booths and rides just outside the city. But
to return to la Tarasca, it was basically a short parade full of bellydancers
dancing, big Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand puppets walking, marching band
music playing, and colored confetti falling from every balcony. While it was a
short parade, I have never seen the streets so packed. It's a wonderful thing to
see the community come together to celebrate. After the parade, I went back to
the apartment because the other Penn State PIRE becarios and I had decided to host
a family-style dinner for our Granadino friends. We spent the day cleaning the
apartment top to bottom, planning the menu, and grocery shopping. Then Clair
and I went to the University because we had a participant scheduled for the
evening. After eating ourselves silly at our family dinner, the whole group of
us went to la Feria. As I mentioned before, the Feria is a big carnival style festival
in the campo (in the parts outside the city) with booths, rides, and tent
restaurants. I rode a tacky haunted house ride and the bumper cars. I'm not
sure if Spaniards are more competitive when it comes to carnival rides or if
someone was just out to get me, but all I remember is one extremely rowdy bumper
car barreling towards me and the next thing I know I wasn't in my car anymore.
I was on the ground. Flung like a ragdoll. I guess seatbelts are required on
park rides at the Feria? But don't worry, I'm still in one piece! But indeed,
it was quite the adrenaline rush. Well anyways, on your next trip to Granada,
remember that you've been warned about the bumper cars at la Feria. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday June 7 - The University was closed Thursday and
Friday due to the Feria. I took advantage of my day to take care of some work.
As usual, I went to work recruiting participants via email. While I did my laundry,
I turned on the TV and to my surprise, I found Spanish-dubbed Desperate
Housewives. It made me feel like I was back at home! During the night I tried <i>arachina</i> for the first time with my friend
and colleague from the lab, Francesco. Being Italian, he told me it is a type
of Italian food I must try before leaving Europe. It turns the guy knows his
food! The arachina was like a little hot pocket filled with rice and peas and
chicken and sauce. Pretty good. I went to bed early because I had an early bus
to catch in the morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday June 8 - I woke up at 6am to catch my 8am bus to Cádiz,
a beautiful city in south-western Andalucía. In short, Cádiz
was my favorite city in Andalucía (after Granada of course) mainly for
its beautiful coast, it's small town feel, and the sweet people I met. To
summarize, I ate shark for the first time and I also ordered a plate of the
famous regional plato <i>pescaito frito</i>
(fried fish). I caught some rays at la Caleta beach and wandered over to
explore the rest of Cádiz's stunning coast. Because I made friends with a boy
from France and a girl from Italy, my brain was in language absorption overload
by the time I went to bed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday June 9 - After spending the day in Cádiz,
I headed off to Sevilla, as it is en route to Granada from Cadiz (when you are
taking the bus). My friend from home is studying there for the summer, so he
showed me around the city. We took a walk by the Guadalquivir river and he
showed me some of his favorite nooks and crannies. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday June 10 -Sunday morning when I woke up, almost
everything was closed. But there was a religious procession going on in the
barrios (the neighborhoods) that morning, so I got to see some the church
members carrying la hostia (the body of Christ) on a float through the street.
It was like a mini neighborhood version of the Corpus Christi. But I was saddened
to realize that due to this religious holiday, the great Cathedral of Sevilla
(the largest Gothic Church in all the Iberian Peninsula) was closed. But luckily
there was a loophole: if you attend mass you can get in. So, after mass, I
walked around the church grounds and came across the tomb of none other than Christopher
Colombus. To be honest, I expected his tomb to be bigger, but then again,
anything would seem unimportant in comparison to La Catedral de Sevilla is. Later,
we walked to Plaza Espana, Sevilla's biggest plaza. Its claim to fame are its beautifully
decorated plaques that honor each of the autonomous communities of Spain. After
this touristy stop, I was in the mood to cool off and relax (Sevilla is so hot
at this time of the year). So, we went to Park María Luisa to play in fountains.
Before catching my bus home, my friend and I cooked dinner at my hostel with some
friends that we made. The Eurocup was on, so the atmosphere was lively to say
the least. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday June 11 - Today I had a full schedule. I ran three
participants. So from the research perspective, we had a very productive day at
the lab! Por la noche, I went to San Miguel Alta, the viewpoint with the
highest altitude in all of Granada proper. It was quite humbling to see the
city from so high up, but my favorite <i>mirador</i>
(viewpoint) is still San Nicholas in Albayzin.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday June 12 - Today, in the morning, Clair and I
stumbled upon a new park where we can exercise. It had tons of machines and
trails to play on. It was a bit curious though because we were the only young people
there. Let it be known that the elderly of Granada really do seem to take care
of their health. I hope to follow suit! I also found it curious that they don't
wear exercise clothes to exercise. They wear slacks and work shirts, so we
stuck out like sore American thumbs with our exercise pants and tanktops! We
had a participant in the late afternoon today, and after working at the lab for
an hour or so, we went home for a family dinner night at the <i>piso</i> (apartment). I tried (and failed
miserably) at cooking salmorejo, which I had eaten in Cordoba and loved. I
thought it would be quick and easy, so I invited some of our Spanish friends
and colleagues from the lab to join us. But alas, I cannot follow a recipe and
instead of adding two <i>teeth</i> of
garlic, I put in two <i>heads</i>. But the
failed dinner aside, we still enjoyed great company!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Wednesday June 13 - Clair
and I had a 9am participant in the morning and Melissa and Alvaro presented
their work to the lab group. They did a great job explaining their work and it
was nice for me to get a formal update on what is happening with their
experiments and data. After their presentations, I went to Playa Salobreña
with Clair and Melissa. This is by far my favorite beach in Granada. I like it
because it's got a breathtaking view of the white-washed town, a castle on the
hill off in the distance, and a rock that you can climb that looks out over the
ocean. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday June 14 - Today was a day for chores. Because I had
no participants, I spent the day cleaning the apartment and buying some of
those last-minute things that I've been putting off ever since I got here. I
bought a cd of traditional flamenco music, some more Granadino clothing, and a
whole bunch of other keepsakes. Later that night, Clair dyed my hair black. Although
I thought this <i>morena</i> (dark-haired
girl) disguise would make me blend in more with the people of Granada, they
still call me <i>rubia rubia</i> (blondie,
light haired girl!) when I walk down the street. I guess you can take a girl
from Pennsylvania but you can't take the Pennsylvania from the girl. Tonight Spain
had a Eurocup match with Ireland I believe, so I went for tapas with my friend
Hana to watch the game and soak up some futbol frenzy. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday June 15 - For this weekend, my plan was to see the
small town of Ronda and the weird English colony of Gibraltar. I left for Ronda
at 6:50am and spent my time climbing the rocks, playing in waterfalls, and admiring
the feats of ancient engineering that are the bridges of Ronda. It was a
whirlwind of sightseeing, but it was like nothing I had ever experienced before
(I'll have to post pictures). Then during late afternoon, I left Ronda for
Gibraltar. To say the least, Gibraltar is interesting. Despite the big signs
saying PASSORT CONTROL IMPORTANT, passport control is a joke. I walked from the
Spanish side to the English side and the police officer didn't even glance at
the passport in my hand. Tonight was an annual Gibraltarian festival that
celebrates all the different cultures in the colony. It centered on a
Gibraltarian pastry called the Catalina (I wouldn't recommend it unless you
like the consistency of paper mache). But there were fireworks and good Indian
food. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:
minor-latin;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Wingdings">J</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday June 16 - Today I took the cable car up the rock
(really, it's a mountain, but the locals call it the rock) to see 1) the native
monkeys that live there and walk around and jump on you 2) St. Michael's Caves,
which is beautiful with its dripping stalagmite forms and 3) the War Tunnels,
where the English soldiers lived for three years to defend the military base
from the Spanish during the Great Siege. After that, I spent a quiet evening
enjoying Main Street and I called it a night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday June 17 - I got up early today and had a big English
breakfast at the Ocean Village port in Gibraltar with my friend Eva. After
eating, I made the trek to <i>la frontera</i>
(the border between Spain and Gibraltar), ran to and almost missed the bus to
Algeciras, and from there bought my ticket back home to Granada. After
unpacking and resting a little, I grabbed dinner at a sushi place (a sushi
place in Spain...who knew!?) with Clair and Sara. Then, of course, I went to an
Internet café so that I could call and message my dad and grandpap to wish them
a HAPPY FATHER'S DAY! &nbsp;I then took a walk
to the mirador San Nicholas in Albayzin to enjoy the view. With the view from
this mirador, nothing in life can be too bad.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday June 18 - Today we had a participant scheduled, but
he had to cancel due to an emergency. So I spent the day taking care of chores
around the house and trying to re-email any participants that showed any
interest at all in participating in my study. Now, if you remember from my
first blog, I borrowed Alvaro's mother's flamenco dress for Dia de la Cruz at
the beginning of May. Well, my trip here ends soon, so I thought it best to
return it pronto. Once I got to his house, his mom invited me to stay for
dinner and watch the Spain-Croatia match with them and some friends. Amongst
other tipical Spanish tapas, we ate dates with bacon, salmorejo (with the proper
amount of garlic this time), croquettes, and shrimp. After the game, I got to
listen in on some Spanish political discussion. It was great fun and
comprehensive L2 input to boot. I left full and happy, and with some new futbol-watching
vocabulary phrases to put in my notebook!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday - I spent today checking in with participants,
trying to secure a few final ones before my time here in Granada ends. Then
Alvaro, Clair, and I spent the evening at the lab going through all our data to
make sure we had everything where it should be. Then we had to go through and
make sure each of our bags has all the necessary research equipment - to make
sure we don't leave any pieces of the equipment behind! On the way home from
the University, Clair and I grabbed a tapa, something we're sure to miss back
in the states. Once back at the apartment, we went to town cleaning. As of July
2<sup>nd</sup>, the place is no longer ours so we had to make sure everything
was spotless and looking like it did the first day we got here. Check!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday - Today Clair and I went to the University early
in the morning to finish up some last bit of work. We wanted to go through each
file one by one and make sure everything was there one more time. We
consolidated all of our data from all the lab booths onto our hard drives and
personal computers. We then went through and made sure our handwritten participant
sheets matched the data we have. In the end, we have run thirty-six
participants (yay!), everything looks great with the data, and we can't wait to
start analyzing all that we've collected here. In terms of my upcoming
departure from Granada, my friend Sara from home came to meet me in Granada today
so that we could travel through Europe together. Although today was a whirlwind
of packing, planning, cleaning, and working, it was all worth it come nighttime:
we PIRE researchers planned a goodbye party with our friends from the lab so
that we could see everyone one last time before leaving. I couldn't imagine a
better ending.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday June 21 - Early in the morning today I leave
Granada for a ten day trip to San Sebastian, Paris, and Rome. My plan? Enjoy
some culinary genius in Spain's most talked-about beach city in the northern Basque
region (San Sebastian), stroll on by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and oogle at
Rome's famous Trevi Fountain. I must admit I am feeling a bit nostalgic about
leaving Granada, as it is now my second home. But I should think the road ahead
will also bring unforgettable adventures, so I can't be too sad!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As always, thank you for taking the time to read my blog. If
you have any questions or comments about my trip, my work, the city, or <i>any</i> of my experiences here in Spain at
all- please ask (I assure you I will never tire of talking about my summer
here). Until then, 'ta luego!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">-Un saludo,</p>

            After 6 weeks, 27 participants, and mountains of voice recordings and reaction time data, the end of my trip to Sweden is nearing. While I'm excited that I will be back in the USA just in time for the 4th of July, I will definitely miss working at the lab here in Sweden.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>The Humlab is a great place to work. Not only is all of the furniture very modern and Swedish (yes, it is like living and working in IKEA), but because of the interdisciplinary nature of the lab, there are cool experiments going on everywhere. In addition, there are always interesting lectures to attend in which people use all sorts of cool technology to study language. I'll admit, some of it is a bit over my head, however being surrounded by so many people bringing together technology and different disciplines to study human language and behavior is truly inspiring.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This inspiration has made long hours of transcription and coding kind of fun. I cannot wait to see the results and see if they match what I've gathered anecdotally from collecting the data and what the hypotheses are. That being said, collecting data has gotten more and more difficult as the semester ended here and our building, campus, and town have completely emptied out (a la Penn State summer, but with no summer classes).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm looking forward to using the quiet to keep coding and to celebrate Midsummer (which is much bigger than Independence Day!) I have yet to Midsummer, which takes place next weekend, but I am looking forward to learning and experiencing a holiday that I have a heard a lot about since we arrived in Sweden. Hopefully next week I will have more information on what it means to celebrate Midsummer's Eve like a true Swede!</div>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
Grad">I'm getting realllly used to transportation problems by now. It seems as
though I curse every mode of public transportation that I come into contact
with, whether it's airplane, train, bus, ferry, whatever. Thus, it came as no
surprise that what was supposed to be a simple day trip to Liverpool with two
girls from the Centre turned into quite an unexpected adventure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We spent the day enjoying the culture of the
nearby city and responsibly made it to an early train back to Bangor.
However,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>an emergency situation on the
tracks caused us to miss our connection, ultimately landing us back in North
Wales well past midnight. This was especially problematic for me since the
buses had stopped running by that point and the train we were on did not stop
in the small village where I am staying. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Luckily one of my traveling companions,
Fraibet, allowed me to stay with her for the night. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
Grad">This sort of adventure makes me realize that I would never have such a
night in my hometown, Towanda Pa. Or, for that matter, in most other places in
the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the biggest
differences I've noticed between "home" and "abroad" is the thorough system of
public transportation here. It's really quite impressive that there is a train
station and several bus stops in even the smallest of towns, a luxury that is
often reserved for more metropolitan areas in the States. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>I think about how amazing it would be to have
the same system in America, but I understand that this is simply not possible
in such a large country.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
Grad">I only have a week and a half left to enjoy Wales, and in this time I
plan to do some last-minute sightseeing, run as many participants as I can
possibly can, and attend a couple more talks before going off to Ukraine,
Latvia, and Germany. It won't be the last time I see Bangor, though!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the middle of July I will be returning to
the university for their Summer School in Bilingualism. In this week-long
event, I will take courses on topics like second language processing, ERPs, and
implicit and explicit L2 learning. I can already tell that I will really take
away a lot from this, judging by the preparatory readings I've started delving
into. All in all, PIRE has been an incredible learning experience in every
aspect, and it's not over yet!</span></p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Hola</i> from Granada!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm writing my first and only blog here at the end of my
stay in Granada because my PIRE travels have been a seriously whirlwind
experience and they have flown by faster than I ever expected. Everything has
been really fun, really productive, and somewhat exhausting at times, so here's
a few highlights:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Probably the most important thing to lead with is that
Teresa Bajo and her lab group have been absolutely wonderful. From day 1 when
Luis showed up at my door to show me my way to the grocery store and then introduce
me to some fellow lab members and the wonderful world of tapas I have felt so
welcome and like I can count on them for anything. It has been delightful
getting to know them all and their work. One thing that really struck me upon
arrival here, but which turned out to be very comforting, as well, is to see
how similar the work environment is to our own at PSU. The relationships
between faculty and students, the relationships and friendships among students,
the things they talk about, the fact that participants NEVER know whose experiment
they are showing up for nor which lab they should be in (too funny) is all very
much like the way we do things in the Thomas basement. Having studied and
traveled abroad before, the general cultural differences didn't scare me when I
was preparing for my departure, but I was nervous about <i>working</i> and <i>doing research</i>
abroad, and that has been an incredibly productive and gratifying experience. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My first week in Granada was mostly spent getting my
bearings, and then helping the undergraduate PIRE students get theirs as well,
with many thanks to Alvaro, our Granada insider, for leading us around like a
tour group on our first couple of days. The second week we began the hunt for
participants in earnest. Luckily for us, Clair was really enthusiastic about
creating posters and hanging them around the city to recruit English-speakers,
so my cell phone started ringing off the hook pretty quickly. It is not
particularly fun to watch your prepay phone minutes disappear before your very
eyes (not used to that at home), but it was all for a good cause. I ran 10
participants in my first 3 days in the lab. It was a little hectic, to say the
least, but it felt good to know I was getting lots of data! And the phone calls
brought me to a new realization that I wasn't expecting...after so many years of speaking
Spanish fluently, I figured I'd never be comfortable speaking Spanish over the
phone - but I'm getting good at it! Thank you, PIRE, for making this bilingual
even more bilingual than before!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The rest of my time has been spent running participants,
spending 10-12 hours a day on campus because when its 92 degrees outside it's
not worth the walk down the hill and then back up it again under the midday sun
to take my lunch break anywhere else but the cafeteria. All the men working in
the cafeteria know me well as the American girl who needs her receipt (this one's
for you, Sharon!) <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Wingdings">J</span>
I ran 37 participants in all - just short of my goal of 40, but I think they'll
be sufficient for my needs. Unfortunately, I've been so busy I haven't had a
chance to look at any of the data yet.&nbsp;
On weekends I got to know Granada and my colleagues from Teresa's lab -
a beautiful city and a great bunch! - and I reconnected with my old friend from
Argentina who I met when I studied abroad there in college. His vacation to
Spain happens to have coincided with my time here. It was surreal to see him
Spain after so long, but a welcome treat, indeed!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This past Wednesday, Sara, Emily, Clair and I presented our
projects at the weekly meeting of Teresa's lab group (on Wednesdays rather than
Fridays, but otherwise very CLS-like). I had presented the pilot study that I
did as a precursor to my current project before, but never in Spanish, so that
was exciting and a fun challenge. I'm not really accustomed to talking about my
research in Spanish, since we tend to present and publish in English. More
interesting was the experience of helping the undergraduates do a preliminary
analysis of their data and prepare their presentations. In general, this PIRE
experience that I've been sharing with these four girls has been gratifying and
reinforcing in terms of realizing my love of teaching and sharing knowledge. I've
been realizing day after day that some of the biggest highlights of this
experience have been things like hearing Melissa use correctly a word that I
just taught her yesterday, or seeing Sara get excited about the number of
participants she's scheduled for next week. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the end our presentations at the <i>reunion de grupo</i> went very well and all of the undergrads did a
great job giving their presentation in Spanish! Teresa had said it would be
okay to present in English, since everyone in the lab understands English, but
after my suggestion (arm twisting? demanding?) they decided to give it a shot
and present in Spanish. They all did fabulously well and it has been a true
pleasure to see their Spanish improve so quickly over the last few weeks. The
data they've collected is shaping up to be interesting, too. I can't wait to
get back to State College and dig into it all with them when we get back to
campus in the fall!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But alas, my time has zipped by and it's time to move on to
the next phase of my journey - a brief vacation here in Southern Spain with my
mom, and then back to State College to teach Spanish 3! My experience in
Granada has been enriching all around - personally and professionally - and I
hope to return again someday soon, and to see all of these wonderful people
again. Thanks to PIRE and our PIs for a great opportunity and a great summer!<o:p></o:p></p>

            Hello again from Leipzig! Time is flying by and it is difficult to believe that I am already halfway through my time here at the MPI. I am excited to report that I have finished testing my 25 German native speakers. Additionally I have entered all of their biographical information, transcribed all of their recordings, and coded for accuracy on relevant tasks. I am now preparing to analyze the data with the help of Dr. Jackson -- thank goodness for Skype!<br /><br />The one thing that has proven problematic is finding late English-German bilinguals who are fluent in German. I have put up flyers in academic buildings, student cafeterias, libraries, language schools, MPI buildings, English churches, bookstores, study abroad offices, and international offices. I have spread the word to everyone I have talked to and yet...still no participants. I do have a couple of leads, but it's not a lot to go on. Would anyone have any helpful suggestions for getting in contact with more potential participants? I would really like to find as many as possible while I am here!<br /><br />Otherwise things are going smoothly. Last weekend my parents, who were vacationing in England, boarded a RyanAir flight to Leipzig for a visit. It was great to see them and fun to explore Leipzig together. In fact, because I was at the institute each day, they ended up seeing a lot of things in Leipzig than I have yet to check out. Luckily, they provided me with lots of ideas for things to explore on the weekends!<br /><br />Yesterday Jonathan Peelle, who is visiting from the University of Pennsylvania, gave a talk at the MPI. It was entitled, "The neural and cognitive consequences of acoustic detail during speech comprehension." I was able to attend (now that I am done testing German speakers I have a much more flexible schedule), and I very much enjoyed his talk. <br /><br />This weekend is <i>Bachfest</i> in Leipzig.The composer Johann Sebastian Bach worked at the <i>Thomaskirche</i> in Leipzig, so there is a strong connection between him and this city. There are events going on all weekend around town. I am hoping to catch some of the free open-air concerts. Additionally, today the European Championship begins! This will last throughout the entire month and will be a fun time to be in Europe. The German flag is already starting to appear everywhere in anticipation of the competition: on cars, clothing and on buildings. There are "Public Viewing" sites all over Leipzig (and all over Germany) where you can have a drink and watch the games with other fans. Germany plays their first match tomorrow against Portugal and it promises to be an exciting game! Let's go, Deutschland!<br /><br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            Today I opened up Google only to be pleasantly surprised with the Swedish flag (still not sure if that's just because I'm in Sweden). Today is Sweden's version of the 4th of July--"Independance Day." It's actually nothing like the 4th of July. From what I gather from participants and lab colleagues, this day, at some point in the 1500s Swedish Parliament was formed. The Swedes mark this momentous occasion by taking a day off and barbequing and having a raucous celebration...just kidding. I have been informed that everyone has quite forgotten what this day is, so they just stay home and relax. In fact, to celebrate this day could be considered racist because flying the flag or in anyway celebrating Sweden is very uncomfortable for most Swedes. In a way, I suppose this goes along with everything we have learned about Sweden up to this point. The ideal Swede is very reserved, modest and they focus on the group more than the individual...they don't call attention to themselves in manner or in dress, so I suppose that by extension, they don't call attention to their country by celebrating this holiday. Thus the university is closed, and since Emma and I decided to run participants on this holiday (in the spirit of not celebrating it) we are getting quite a bit of exercise as every time we have a participant we must escort them in and out through a maze of alarm-armed doors and stairwells.&nbsp;<div>Lest you think we are working too hard on a national holiday--midway through our trip we have realized that it is crunch time for data collection. While the semester here officially ends on June 15th, students have been taking exams for the past three weeks, and since this is a Swedish version of Penn State, the population is declining at a dramatic rate! Therefore we are scrambling to get everyone into the lab before our participant pool has run dry...&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p class="MsoNormal">Hello friends! It is week five here in Granada and I have been
busy busy busy. As far as the research goes, there was a lot to do and I
learned a lot about the programs we use at the lab as well as familiarized
myself with the process of extracting, analyzing, and making sense of my data. But
while the majority of my week had to do with my work at the lab, I also managed
to squeeze in some Andalucian travel time over the weekend to visit Spain's
biggest mosque-turned-cathedral. But, you can read more about that below.
Enjoy! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday May 31 - When I woke up Thursday morning, I only
had four participants scheduled. But it was a lucky day for me because two more
participants emailed me in the afternoon to tell me they were free and able to
come to the lab later in the day to participate in my experiment. Having six
participants in one day is <i>really</i>
exciting. It's kind of like when you think you only have a five dollar bill in
your wallet but then you find you also have an extra twenty shoved below it. After
my full day of running participants, I ran back downtown to meet with the
others from the PIRE cohort to start data analysis; we present our work to the
department in less than a week.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday June 1 - On Friday, I had one participant in the
morning. After running him, I stopped by the public library by my apartment to
return my book and while I was there I picked out a new one. I told the librarian
I didn't like my last book because it was too sad for my taste, so he recommended
<i>El Bol</i><i>ígrafo
de Gel Verde</i> by Eloy Moreno for me because it's light and contemporary. Although
I'm only on page 6 (it takes me a lot longer to read in my second language), I really
like the writing style so far. Later in the evening, I went to my friend's
barbeque just a little outside the city. It was a nice breezy night and I ate a
lot of pancetta, morcilla, and pechuga de pollo. Muy bien!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday June 2 - Early Saturday morning, I left for Córdoba.
This was the first time I've ever gone on a trip alone. At first, I was a
little nervous that I would be lonely all by myself in a new city, but within
the first couple hours, I ended up randomly running into some friends I met in
Málaga
last weekend. And upon checking into my hostel, one of the workers who had just
gotten off work offered to show me around the city's major sites. These include
El Puente Romano (the roman bridge), Calle de Flores (a small alleyway covered
in flowers), a little restaurant that apparently serves "Córdoba's
best" salmorejo (Córdoba's version of gazpacho, which is heavier and richer
with some more bread and eggs and jam mixed in), and the Synagogue (which is
the only remaining one in Córdoba and one of only three in all of
Spain due largely in part to the Spanish Inquisition). &nbsp;After, I met up with my friends and we went
out to dinner. Having already tried Cordoba's famous salmorejo, I had to get a
taste of their other famous plate: rabo de toro (oxtail stew). It was
unexpectedly delicious. The group of us from the hostel went to a flamenco
show, but due the rough economic times in Spain, there wasn't a big enough
audience to warrant a show and so it was cancelled. With no other plans for the
night, we wandered to one of the plazas where there was a live Cuban music
performance. It wasn't our original plan, but it ended up being debatably the
best part of the day. Before going to bed, I hung out on the terraza of the hotel
and met some friends from Quebec. They'll be visiting Granada in the next
couple days, so hopefully I'll see them again. They taught me some buzz phrases
in French that I'll definitely be using when I travel there in the next couple
weeks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br />
Sunday June 3 - Today I started the day off right because for the first time in
a long time, l slept in and managed to get a full eight hours of sleep- a
rarity for me here. After grabbing breakfast, I met up with my new friend Abdou,
who works at the hostel. Born and raised in Senegal, he has lived in Spain for
the past three years. But these last three years haven't changed much in terms
of his African culinary roots because he cooked me an authentic Senegal dish for
lunch. We topped the meal off with some African tea, which I really liked
because, unlike what I am used to, he added a lot of sugar. Now that I've
discovered how good this is, I don't think I can go back to un-sugared tea. After
we finished lunch, I headed off to see Cordoba's biggest tourist site: the
Mezquita. This building is highly unique not only because it is the biggest
mosque in Spain but also because it has a huge Catholic cathedral sprouting
right out the middle of it. For this reason, it tells a lot about the long
history of both the coexistence and the rivalry between the Muslim and Catholic
religions in Spain over the years. After my visit to the Mezquita, I grabbed
some food, pick up my suitcase from the hostel, and I headed for the bus
station. The ride back to Granada was some much needed downtime. I spent those
three quiet hours reading and looking out my window as the hills, olive trees,
and the moon whizzed on by. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday June 4 - I had a participant Monday morning, but I
went to the university a little early to start working on analyzing my data. I
updated my SPSS program and started programming my experiment analysis. After
running my participant, I had lunch with my friend and he informed me a lot on
the background of La Feria (the festival that will be going on this week in
Granada). Then, last minute, I got another participant for the day. After running
her on my experiment, I stuck around the University to send out a couple
emails, schedule a participant for next week, and code some LHQ data. Then I
headed home to start preparing my presentation with the other PIRE researchers.
We are scheduled to present our experiment to the department on Wednesday so we
had to meet to analyze our data and put our presentation together.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that's all for now. <span lang="ES">Stay tuned!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
