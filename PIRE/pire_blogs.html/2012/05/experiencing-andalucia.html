                                        <p class="MsoNormal">Hello again from Granada. It's my fourth week here and I
can't believe how fast the time seems to be flying by. As of now, I have
successfully run twenty six participants and I have a full list of potential
participants scheduled for the upcoming weeks. So from the research perspective,
things are looking great. And on the topic of participants, I have to say that
I have really been enjoying running mine because they have proven to be a great
way for me to make friends here. Not infrequently, after my sessions end, my
participants ask me if I would be interested in an intercambio because they
want to practice their English. Because I also would like to practice my Spanish,
it works out for us both to teach and learn from each other. In this way, I
have found many of my closest friends here and gotten to better know the city
and its people. Vale, now I'll start with the day by day breakdown. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday May 24 - Today my morning participant cancelled
because she was sick. However, I managed to get another participant in her
place, which still left me with three participants for the day. For lunch, I
ate with my friend Rafa lunch at la Facultad de Filosofia y Letras. Rafa is a
graduate student studying Old and Middle English. My talks with him are always
enjoyable because he tells me about Old English tales like Beowulf, the
transformation of Germanic languages, and of course Spanish as well. Later in
the afternoon, my friend Mallory came back to visit me for the weekend. We had
tickets to go to Málaga for the weekend, but our bus didn't leave until
Friday night. Entonces, we still had one night and a day together in Granada
before our trip. For dinner on Thursday, we went to Francesco's house in
Albayzin and he made us some authentic Italian pasta. Delicioso. After, Mallory
and I went back to her hotel to catch up on some sleep. Sidenote: as it turns
out, this hotel (Hotel Reina Cristina) is of important historical note.
Federico Garcia Lorca (Granada's most prominent writer) took refuge here while
Franco was hunting him down. Later, Franco's troops found Garcia Lorca and
killed him. To this day, no one knows for sure where his body is. And what is
interesting is that his family doesn't even want to know. I've read this bit of
information somewhere along the way in my studies, but it was validated the
other night when my friend Rafa told me that Garcia Lorca's niece (a colleague
of his from the university) also does not want to know where her uncle's body
is. Essentially, the family doesn't want to create a big scene. They want him
to remain an untouched legacy. Learning that Rafa knew Garcia Lorca's niece was
all very exciting for me because it doesn't often happen that I read about
something in my history book and then meet someone who is involved directly in
that historical context.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday May 25 - Today my participant had to cancel our
appointment, but luckily he was interested in rescheduling. But because I had
no participants to run and because I was caught up on all my work, I had the
whole day free. Although I missed being at the University, I ended up having a
wonderful day soaking up Granadino culture. Mallory and I went to las Cuevas de
Sacromonte. Sacromonte, or <i>sacred
mountain</i>, is the barrio gitano (gypsy neighborhood) located in the
mountains above Albayzin. Sacromonte is known for these caves and also for its
famous Flamenco shows. Learning about the culture of this barrio interested me,
but what intrigued me most as I walked through and read the plaques on the
walls was this little factoid: in the 1950s, gypsies came in great numbers to
Sacromonte and almost all of them lived in cave houses. This was only<i> sixty </i>years ago that people were
actually living in these caves! I would recommend this museum for anyone. The
ride up the mountain alone is enough to make you swoon. You get a breathtaking
view of the city and it's a nice quiet oasis apart from the inner city. After
walking through the caves, we headed back down to the city to eat and pack for
our excursion to Málaga. We grabbed a late night bus and arrived at our
hostel around midnight. Upon arrival, Mallory and I were extremely hungry and
the owner of the hostel kindly made us some Argentine empanadas. As our hostel
was right on the beach, we sat outside for a while to enjoy la brisa maritima
(sea-side breeze), but we soon got tired and turned in for the night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday May 26-Today I woke up and got some breakfast. Then
Mallory and I headed into el centro (the city center) for a free walking tour,
which our hostel offered. The tour lasted three hours and I loved every minute
of it. I learned about Reina Isabel, Fernando, Franco, los romanos, los
fenicios, los arabes, the Spanish Inquisition, typical Malagueño
culture...etc. After, we grabbed a quick bite to eat and then headed to the beach.
I have to admit I like the Málaga beach much more than the one I've
visited in Granada. It's actually got sand instead of just rock, so my feet
were a lot happier here. Also, there are cute little chiringuitos (beach-side
cafes) that make for a fun, young, vibrant ambiance. For dinner, we headed back
to the hostel because they were making family style paella for all the
travelers. After eating, we stayed at the hostel for a while to chat and get to
know the other travelers. For the night, one of the girls who worked at the
hostel took us out to the centro so that we could see the nightlife. Y hasta la
fecha, no tenia nada de lamentar. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday May 27 - Today was our last day in Málaga.
Everything ends too soon! After breakfast, we headed into the centro to visit both
Picasso's house as well as his art museum. &nbsp;Here I saw some important Picasso pieces, but
found that my favorite is one that's not well-known or highly acclaimed; it's
called something along the lines of<i> La Mujer
a la Puerta del Baile.</i> It's a small work and it uses a lot of shadows,
which makes it a bit mysterious. But I like it a lot because the scene reminds
me of one of my favorite pub/restaurants here in Granada. It's made of wood and
has a lot of candles. Encantador. After having spent upwards of three hours in
museums, we needed a break from cognitive and/or creative activity. So we went
to the beach, a different one this time. Soon enough, however, we were at the
bust station on our way back to Granada for the night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday May 28 - Today I had one participant in the afternoon.
After, I had to a make a copy of my apartment key because the original had been
giving me problems for the past couple weeks. After running my participant, I
spent an hour or two emailing and scheduling participants. After I finished my
work, Mallory and I went shopping at some vintage shops. For dinner, we went to
a restaurant where the waiter ended up sitting down with us and teaching us a
little bit of Gallego (language spoken in Galicia, northwest of Spain). I have
never studied Gallego, so it was interesting to see the similarities and
differences between Gallego, Portuguese, and Spanish. After some tapas and a
Gallego lesson, Mallory and I went to Clair's favorite restaurant/bar to
celebrate her birthday with everyone. !Felíz cumpleaños
a ella!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday May 29 - Today was a bit sad for me because Mallory's
stay with me had drawn to a close. Early in the morning, I took her back to the
airport and after saying our goodbyes, I headed home for a clerical day full of
laundry, cleaning, blogging, emailing, finance-sorting...etc. For dinner, I met my
friend in el centro. As always in Granada, I ate well and with good company.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday May 30 - Today I ran one participant in the
morning and two in the afternoon. In my downtime, I grabbed lunch with mi amiga
Esther and her other friend Laura. Then I took care of some work and booked my
tickets for this weekend. Córdoba here I come! At midnight, the Penn
State cohort went to los baños arabes in Albayzin. This may have
been on my list of top three things to do in Granada. The experience was better
than any spa I have ever been to in the U.S. First, we entered a dark cave with
sweet smelling candles and sparkling lanterns. The cave was steamy and there
were ornate Arabic tiles lining the walls. We sat down to have some sweet tea
and then started with the baths. First, you enter el agua templada (warm water).
This is where the people congregate and relax. Then, you move to el agua caliente
(hot water), which gets your heart pumping and blood flowing. Once you feel you
can't take any more hear, you move on to el agua frío (cold water...but in my
opinion, very cold water, haha). The point of this all is to get healthy
circulation of blood throughout your system. But antiguamente (in the past),
the main purpose of the Arab bathhouses was to clean oneself for religious &nbsp;purposes. Although it is used more as a spa
today, traditionally, the Muslims would go to the bathhouse to wash themselves
before praying, as it is against religious practice to pray when one's body is
dirty. After soaking and relaxing in the waters, we then got massages. This was
my favorite part and so relaxing. After we were instructed to take a shower. We
lingered a bit in the baths after the massage, but soon our reservation was up,
and we had to leave. But I have a feeling I will be going back sometime soon. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, that's all for now. Thanks for reading, and as always,
¡pásalo
bien!</p>
