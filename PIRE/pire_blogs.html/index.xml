            <title>Bye Bye (Is How They Say &quot;Bye&quot; In Nijmegen)</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<span id="docs-internal-guid-a35f3eb2-782f-9b01-c830-68e9e3971af7"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">There is time for just a few brief words before I pack up my laptop and put it into storage as Mary Beth, Mindy and I embark on the last leg of our PIRE adventures -- two weeks in Spain!</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">From State College, to Palenque, to Nijmegen, this research experience has been a whirlwind of new languages, ideas, challenges, faces, places, and friends. After our first lab meeting with John Lipski in August 2013, the notion of fieldwork was just beginning to materialize as a possibility. John introduced us to the inner workings of Lengua and to Palenque, but actually flying to Colombia to pursue linguistics seemed a bit farfetched. </span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Fast forward to May 2014: Mary Beth, Mindy and I flew to Cartagena. We immersed ourselves in the languages and the cultures. In Palenque, we learned about much more than a creole. We encountered an entirely different, yet not so foreign way of life and made some incredible friends along the way. Then, in June, we arrived in the Netherlands. With the help of Dr. Pieter Muysken and numerous other grad students and professors at Radboud University, we took our raw data and processed it into meaningful, sharable results. Besides making progress with our research, we had the chance to really live life day-to-day in a new city. Also, I had the chance to befriend and to play ultimate with Radboud's team, the BFrisbee2's, a great bunch of people. Even when I'm in beautiful Spain and back in State College continuing work on my research, I will sorely miss Nijmegen.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">And so, the time has come to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who made this summer possible. This wasn't just a overseas research crunch-the-numbers kind of experience; this was unforgettable. Thank you to everyone at Penn State who works hard to make PIRE happen. Thank you to Dr. Muysken for being such a patient teacher and for being so excited on our behalves. Thank you to John for everything, particularly helping us to love Palenque as much as he does. Thank you to all the kind, generous, (mostly Dutch) people I've met here, especially the BFrisbee2's. Thank you to Jenny who worked on a separate PIRE project in Nijmegen. I wish she could have stayed longer! And finally, thank you to Mindy and Mary Beth. Without you guys, this summer would've had a lot less laughter and far fewer adventures -- it wouldn't have been the same!</span></p><br /><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/DSCF0885.JPG"><img alt="in den haag.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/DSCF0885-thumb-200x150-402001.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><br /></p><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17.25px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17.25px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Gracias, bedankt, and thanks!</span></div></span> ]]></description>

            <title>Last Days</title>
            <description><![CDATA[







<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two months flew by incredibly fast. These last few days in Nijmegen have been bittersweet. I have conflicting emotions of wanting to go home, see my family and friends, and start the next semester but also not wanting to leave this beautiful country. I don't want the adventures to end either, but thankfully we've got one more left.&nbsp; On Monday we are headed to Spain. We will be traveling to Barcelona, Granada, Malaga, and Seville. It seems like a lot and it was stressful at times to plan but it will definitely be worth it. I am looking forward to exercising my Spanish muscles again. They have been out of use since Colombia, two months ago, and have been struggling to keep quiet. I just hope I can start where I left off with my Spanish speaking. It improved exponentially in Colombia where I was immersed in the language. However, after two months of no practice I am afraid it may have dwindled a little bit. I am very excited to travel to yet another country and experience a culture very different from here in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know my situation was very different from the other PIRE students since it started out with field research, but also because I was fortunate enough to travel with Danny and Mary Beth. We have gotten very close during our travels and I am so happy I was able to experience all of this with them, and I can't forget Jenny! Its crazy how quickly you get close to people while you are traveling. I hardly knew Jenny before this trip and yet we became such great friends. I would have been much more challenging if I were on my own so I am very glad to have been surrounded by wonderful people. It has been great traveling together but also helping each other with our research and sharing ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am so grateful to have been given this opportunity and I would like to thank everyone from PIRE that arranged this experience. I would like to thank Dr. Pieter Muysken for his kindness during our stay and for his brilliance that was shared to improve our experiments. The entire Radboud CLS department was very welcoming and willing to help with our projects (and even invite us to lunch). Thank you to Prof. John Lipski for sharing all things Palenquero with us and for bringing us to Palenque, Colombia. Also, thanks to Prof. Lipski for taking time from your busy schedule to continue consultation with us during our stay here in Nijmegen. I have learned so much about linguistics and what goes into research projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2837.JPG"><img alt="IMG_2837.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/IMG_2837-thumb-200x150-401999.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></p><p class="p1"><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2837.JPG" style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"></a></span></p><p class="p1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span class="s1">I hope all my fellow PIRE students&nbsp;had great summers</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;and are getting some interesting results.

I've spent hours listening to Lengua Palenquera and rearranging spreadsheets to my heart's content. I'm happy with the preliminary results that I've gathered, and am so excited to share this with the CLS this fall! I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Pieter Muysken here at Radboud University, and look forward to continuing to work with and learn more about Lengua throughout my senior year. </span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">I would like to extend a HUGE thank you to our professor John Lipski. He not only taught us about Lengua throughout the past year, shared articles with us, discussed his experiences and answered our many questions, but he also offered us the opportunity to conduct our research projects in Palenque, Colombia. I will never be able to sufficiently express my gratitude for our time in Palenque. It was one of the best experiences of my life. In addition to guiding us through our first research projects, John also introduced us to many incredible Palenqueros whose warmth and kindness I will never forget. He furthermore helped me to realize how much I love the field of sociolinguistics, and I can't wait to keep working with him in the fall!</span></p><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">I would also like to thank my fellow PIREates, Mindy, Danny and Jenny. I could not have asked for better friends to spend the summer with. Together we coded, cooked, learned some Dutch vocabulary, explored via fiets, adventured through Europe and had so much fun. Thank you to each of you for being so smart, fun and wonderful, and I look forward to many more family dinners together this fall. :) </span></span> ]]></description>

            <title>Coding</title>
            <description><![CDATA[







<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spreadsheets have become my life. Everywhere I go I see them. My brain thinks in rectangles. The hardest part about coding is trying to see through the endless possibilities and just focus on one. I look at speech samples from 35 participants and not much is consistent. Which makes perfect sense. We do not all speak exactly the same way. One of the consequences that coincide with field work is that your experiment doesn't turn out exactly the way you plan. So although I was looking at code-switching and have gathered significant data on the topic, I can't help but see how much participants vary in grammatical and lexical features. It was so interesting to see the variation while I was transcribing all of my recordings last month. However, now the variation has become my enemy. Somehow this variation needs to be made into codes so that I can get statistical results of Lengua Palenquera and how it is spoken. It is a slow and thought provoking process. I now truly understand the tediousness of analyzing linguistic data and I hold in high regard researchers who have been doing this for many years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last week Danny, Mary Beth, and I met with a doctoral student who studies Javanese influence on Dutch spoken in Suriname. When I heard this I was blown away. I had no idea there is a Dutch presence in Suriname, and of course I've never heard of Javanese before. I never entirely thought about how many different linguistic situations can be studied. English is my native language so I'm always thinking about bilingualism among English and other languages but I am naive to think in this way when there are so many other language combinations out there. I somewhat acknowledged their existence but never fully thought about just how many possible combinations there are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As far as traveling goes, we have toned down our international adventures a little bit. This week Nijmegen is hosting their annual Four Days Marches. Four Days of over 100,000 incredible people walking 40-50 km. There is an array of people that March; young, old, and the prevalent military group. For those that do not walk, there is plenty of entertainment in the center city. There are large performance stages on most streets, food carts selling international and common carnival foods, a Ferris wheel and other small rides, plus many more activities. Even in four days I don't think it would be possible to see everything going on in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can't believe how fast my time here has gone. I feel that I have achieved a lot but I'm not quite ready to leave yet. I love being in Europe and learning so much about different cultures, cities, and people. I have done this both through traveling and through meeting people in the CLS here at Radboud.&nbsp;</span></p> ]]></description>

When Allied bombers attempted to push the Germans back into Germany, they mistook Nijmegen for a German city and laid siege to it.

As a result,&nbsp;architecture&nbsp;in Nijmegen today features a healthy mix of classic and contemporary style.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font><u style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: xx-large;">Topography &amp; Climate &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Dutch standards, Nijmegen is very hilly.

Students test into one of seven "tracks" at a fairly young age, around the beginning of high school. Although there is room for movement from one track to another, only the most academically inclined students -- those in the top track -- can go on to a university. Others will graduate en route to a college. Still others will be go on to vocational training.

For foreigners attempting to order food or buy a bus ticket, there are no shortages of Dutch to English translators available. For foreigners attempting to learn Dutch, there is little hope. Besides some common&nbsp;ancestry and certain cognates, Dutch and English are not mutually intelligible. Dutch people are the first to declare that Dutch is difficult to pick up. Dutch people are also the first to switch into English when a foreigner is struggling, e.g. trying to order a "pizzadag," which is not a food, but a promotion meaning "pizza day."&nbsp;</font></p></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></b></p></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attitude</b></p></div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stereotypically, Dutch people, including residents of Nijmegen, are friendly, helpful, and humble. The Netherlands has a comparatively small wealth gap and this is evidenced by only slight differences in Nijmegen home sizes. Dutch culture promotes the idea of social equality and scoffs at the notion of showboating or putting on airs. A famous Dutch saying ("Doe maar normaal, dan doe je al gek genoeg.") translates literally to "Just act normal, then you're acting crazy enough as it is!" which translates to "Even though you're weird, it's better to just roll with it."&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout history, outsiders have also voiced their opinion on Dutch culture. In the early 1600s, the Japanese interpreted Dutch forthrightness and lack of social hierarchy as a lack of social grace, suggesting that "Where a Dutch person has walked, not even grass will grow." However, there are acres (and hectares) of grass growing in Nijmegen.</font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font><u style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: xx-large;">Portrayal in the Media &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</u></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="line-height: 22.200000762939453px;">Mainstream American media has not heard of Nijmegen.

            <title>Coming Home</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Here it is- the post I've been dreading writing- the last
post. I've finally completed my research here in Granada, and I don't want to
leave! My flight leaves tomorrow morning, so I'm all packed and ready to go.
This experience was so great, and it came to an end much quicker than I hoped.
In the end I wound up testing 33 participants. I'm very happy with this number.
Although I'm sad to be leaving Spain, I am eager to get home and back to Penn
State in August to start coding my data. I am very excited to see how it all
turns out. I haven't had the opportunity to code any of it yet, so it will be a
complete surprise. Before my last day, which was today, I had the opportunity
to take some pictures around the lab. Here are a few.<o:p></o:p></p>

<a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_7588.JPG"><img alt="IMG_7588.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/IMG_7588-thumb-200x150-401945.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

Both cities were beautiful. Being in central Spain and then northern Spain was
much different than living here in Granada. Both cities are very big and full
of life. Granada is full of life as well, but it's a different, more laid back
life that I grew accustomed to. I met many new people in Madrid, and in
Barcelona I met up with a friend that I met on my trip to Morocco. Although I
only had about 36 hours in both cities, I had the time to explore and see all
the famous sites- the Prado museum, Plaza Mayor, the Sagrada Familia, Park Güell,
and some other things as well. I was happy to be back in Granada yesterday and
today though to say my goodbyes. I spent a lot of time walking around the city
to take it all in before heading home. I stopped by the cathedral and the
Cartuja monastery which I hadn't had the time to see before. They were both
beautiful. I also did some last minute souvenir shopping for my friends and
family back home. It was a great last few days.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1em;">I want to take the time now to give a few shout outs. First
I'd like to say that everyone at CIMCYC was so much help to me while I was here
in Spain. I had many, many questions along the way, and everyone was so willing
to help me, no matter how small the problem. I am very thankful to everyone in
the lab, including my mentor, Teresa, who I am very grateful to for allowing me
to come into CIMCYC and feel like I was part of the team.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next, a big thanks to Paige for making Spain so much fun! We
had so many great experiences together, and I would have been very lost around
Granada and Spain without you here. Have fun traveling around Spain and France
these next two weeks. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next up, Christian! Thank you so much for all of your help
getting my stimuli ready for Spain. Without you I wouldn't have had anything to
bring to Spain, and I am so happy that you were able to help me out. I'm grateful
for your help this summer back at Penn State as well. I'm sure we will be
working together a lot in the fall, and I'm really looking forward to it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And last, but certainly not least, Eleonora. Thank you for
everything these past several months. You helped me so much from the very
beginning of my application right up through my time here in Spain. I'm so
happy we've had the chance to work together, and I can't wait to get back in
the lab this fall!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I hope everyone enjoys the rest of their summer, and I'll be
seeing you all in August. I hope all the other PIRE students had as great a
time as I did, and I'm excited to see all of your end results. Cheers to a
great PIRE Summer 2014.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Recruit, Run, Repeat</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I do
not understand how research was done before the age of the internet. Every day,
I sent out emails to grad students, doctoral students, friends of friends, and
anyone else who I discover is a native English speaker. I sent out so many
emails that I kept a template message in a Word document and just changed the
name each time I emailed someone new. While a lot of the people who responded
were too busy to participate, I was absolutely blown away by the number of
researchers who took the time to help me find other potential recruitment
pools. I have to give a special shout out to Antje Stohr who sent me a long,
detailed email that included the names of English speakers she knew as well as
the heads of departments who may be able to send my recruitment call out in a list
serve. Nearly every time someone people emailed me that they could not
participate, they included at least one other potential recruitment source in
their response. I don't know if it's the researchers at Radboud or linguists in
general, but the individuals I talked to were so willing to help me. Only two
of my participants ended up coming from the SONA system; I found everyone else
through word of mouth. I am so grateful to everyone at Radboud University who
took the time to keep a young, naïve, undergraduate researcher from getting in
over her head. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
tedious as I found splicing sentences, I realized that I love running
participants. It's so gratifying seeing everything I worked for fall neatly
into place. Every day I ran a participant, I arrived at the Spinoza building an
hour early. I bought a delicious specialty coffee that probably had my daily
caloric intake in the whipped cream alone. I went to the cubicle I had booked
for the day, set up all my research equipment, and placed all the forms I
needed the participant to sign in a neat pile next to the laptop. When the
participant arrived, I walked them through the instructions of the experiment,
sat in during the trial sentences, then moved to a desk right outside the
cubicle for the duration of the study. During the hour and a half when my
participant was engaged in the experiment, I either read or chatted with one of
the other researchers also running their study. &nbsp;I loved the routine, the organization, and the
fact that the experiment I worked so hard on was slowly coming to life with
each new participant. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides
recruiting and running participants, my week also consists of a lab meeting
held every Wednesday. I've been to a lot of lab meetings throughout my time
working in Dr. Van Hell's lab, but I have definitely gained a new appreciation
for the presentations researchers give. Ever since I began working on my own
study, I realize just how much hard work goes unsaid in each presentation. The hours
spent creating stimuli, recruiting participants, and analyzing results gets
summed up in a manner of minutes. Each week, I listened to two researchers
discuss their experiments. I left every lab meeting with a deeper appreciation
for potential directions of linguistic research. I can't wait until I become
enough of an expert in the field to provide an insightful, highbrow comment of
my own at the end of a presentation. Right now, I'm more focused on paying
close attention so I can fully understand each researcher's experiment. I
realized I enjoy listening to presentations much more than I enjoy giving them.
At the last lab meeting of the year, I gave the final presentation about my own
research. I created the slide show a week in advance and knew all the talking
points I wanted to discuss. I was so nervous that I wasn't going to sound as
eloquent or educated as the doctoral students and post docs who presented in
the weeks before me. I'm sure I sounded incredibly nervous as I went through my
presentation, and I know I definitely spoke too quickly, especially considering
that English was not the native tongue of many of my audience members.
Nevertheless, I got through the presentation intact. I like to think I answered
all the questions with much aplomb. I'm proud to say that there were no
questions that stumped me completely. After I finished my presentation, I went
out for drinks with other members of Dr. James McQueen's lab. For the first
time, I felt like I was spending time with colleagues rather than superiors. I truly
felt like a researcher.<o:p></o:p></p> ]]></description>

We explored the Van Gogh museum, climbed the I Amsterdam sign, toured the Heineken experience, and visited the Anne Frank house. We celebrated the Fourth of July with a paddle boat ride through the canals of the city, a visit to the tulip and cheese museums, and hot dogs for dinner. On our last rainy day in the city, we strolled through Vondelpark, picking tulips and petting puppies. We also ate poffertjes, a delicious Dutch buttery dessert served with powdered sugar and toppings of your choice (in my case, nutella and banana). We also souvenir shopped in a local flower market, returning to Nijmegen in time for the Quarter final game against Costa Rica! </span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">I Amsterdam</span></p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/B1-xpSTzHFmx5q8Tg5QgdsKfQ15VYCq5pwGjAkwaDaDPSk1iqo8_UWfZ_kCke3dXIMiEUx6uSAfdpgi_F1BdFusDrslh4aGG8qCj7LFRe4RKwa5qiF_AmyewovUxMTVBfA" width="624px;" height="468px;" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" alt="IMG_5236.JPG" /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Poffertjes</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OZJjIAmKCgooGRnOzn3ABnaTbq98N4Mqzcm44C1vki29ChdDlvXR9BqmK25bAVcyzS5bwLe5eLjTXugat6_hFMq_-ptNJHVXSNE9HIj56K4SlSPPLFuEJ0md8GzDQOWJCg" width="624px;" height="468px;" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" alt="IMG_5352.JPG" /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Quarter Finals-- Hup Holland Hup!</span></p><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2SRs2btUwa18D3y73yM-HOmVZUGs8rALzdrp8LNofkyZ0msH58RUn4pyvNFlmAk-qIM_VFtbWTpbPDlkOXhJ2reTs_VJWN6E4IzC3uKMbYqz9hjJVViwNeAucd5PFLFdOw" width="624px;" height="468px;" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" alt="IMG_5415.JPG" /></span></span> ]]></description>

            <title>Four Weeks In...</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Four weeks into PIRE have brought with them plenty of opportunity to develop our research from Palenque. Just last week, Mary Beth, Mindy and I were honored with the chance to present our findings to the LinC research group. Our presentation was preceded by two other presenters focused on attitudes towards East Asian heritage languages in the Netherlands. Afterwards, the three of us outlined our experiences conducting field research in rural Colombia, our specific projects, and our progress with analysis so far in Nijmegen. The questions and feedback from the room were exceptionally helpful. One visiting scholar, Dr. Kofi Yakpo from the University of Hong Kong, shed some particularly interesting light on perceptions of creole languages. Also, we had our first chance to meet our advisor at Radboud, Dr. Pieter Muysken. Dr. Muysken holds a laundry list of international achievements, but was excited to sit down with three undergraduate researchers. In the coming days, we'll have further opportunities to speak with and learn from Dr. Muysken as we continue analysis and start early drafts of our write-ups.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Four weeks into PIRE have also brought with them the temptation to draw comparisons. Colombia and the Netherlands might both be ideal locations for linguistic intrigue, but the two countries are vastly different. Perhaps no place are these differences more pronounced than when using public transportation. Leaving Cartagena by bus might as well be a ride to another planet next to a comparable journey leaving Nijmegen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p><div style="text-align: center;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yw_o8HJLyGg/U7rDT-AsdQI/AAAAAAAAA2g/VvGZAuvTkgs/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-07-07+at+5.56.34+PM.png"><img border="0" height="408" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-Yw_o8HJLyGg%2FU7rDT-AsdQI%2FAAAAAAAAA2g%2FVvGZAuvTkgs%2Fs1600%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2014-07-07%2Bat%2B5.56.34%2BPM.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" style="cursor: move;" /></a></p></div><div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p></div><div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">Guess which one is which.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://www.alitravelstheworld.com/colombia/483x396xcolombia_buses_14_483x396.jpg.pagespeed.ic.DoV2_2bFc0.jpg"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alitravelstheworld.com%2Fcolombia%2F483x396xcolombia_buses_14_483x396.jpg.pagespeed.ic.DoV2_2bFc0.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="cursor: move;" /></a><a href="http://www.metro-magazine.com/images/news/M-BYD-ebus-Netherlands.jpg"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metro-magazine.com%2Fimages%2Fnews%2FM-BYD-ebus-Netherlands.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="cursor: move;" /></a></p></div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p></div> ]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's been
quite a busy and successful past week and a half since my last post.&nbsp; My parents came to visit me here in Mannheim
and we ventured over to Rothenburg for a nice weekend trip.&nbsp; The medieval town was absolutely gorgeous and
a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Mannheim.&nbsp; &nbsp;My
parents forced me to go bike riding (I have a slight fear of bicycles after
living in Penn State with all the crazy biker riders and some personal bad
experiences with bikes) to Kreuth, a very small town where my ancestors are
from.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very interesting to see,
especially because of how different this small town was from Mannheim or other
German cities. &nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><img src="webkit-fake-url://261E7F76-C268-4BF0-B9CB-C02702BFC9A2/application.pdf" /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Upon returning to Mannheim, I was
fortunate to have three more participants.&nbsp;
This brings me up to 29 participants total, which I am very happy
with.&nbsp; I am very excited to analyze all
of the data and see all the results.&nbsp;
Just from recording my participants, I can already tell that my results
are going to be quite interesting, especially from a speech-language
pathologist perspective. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">It's hard to believe that these two
months are already almost over.&nbsp; I
started my goodbyes yesterday and turned in my key to the office that Abby and
I shared.&nbsp; I have three more full days
here and then on Tuesday I am back in the U.S.&nbsp;
Overall, this trip has been an incredible experience and has taught me
many things.&nbsp; First and foremost, it
taught me about conducting my own research and how to recruit
participants.&nbsp; I learned exactly how
powerful word of mouth can be.&nbsp; It was
also a test of my independence.&nbsp; It's
easy to be away at college and just call up mom when you have a problem.&nbsp; That's not so easy here.&nbsp; I had to learn how to manage everything by
myself.&nbsp; I also had to step outside my
comfort zone and make friends and speak the language.&nbsp; This trip also reminded me just how fortunate
I am.&nbsp; I am so blessed to have had this
opportunity to come here in the first place.&nbsp;
Many of my friends might never get to study abroad, so I am so grateful
for this opportunity to learn and grow.&nbsp;
This trip also showed me how great my parents and friends are.&nbsp; They were all so supportive during my entire
trip, and it would have been much harder to accomplish all that I did without
them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><img src="webkit-fake-url://F28F9C86-BC21-479A-B666-514473CF93EF/application.pdf" /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I want to thank Abby for all of her
help during this trip.&nbsp; It was so nice to
have a friend here to explore and work with.&nbsp;
I want to thank Mike Putnam for advising me and helping me out on this
wild ride of research. &nbsp;A huge thank you
to all of the PIRE staff.&nbsp; I will forever
be grateful for this incredible learning experience.&nbsp; Thank you!<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">P.S. &nbsp;Happy 4th of July!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[I've been slacking a bit on my blog! Haven't written in a while, so I have much to catch up on.<div><br /></div><div>In my last entry I signed off talking about my upcoming weekend Morocco trip. Kyra and I took a bus from Granada to Sevilla, then transferred to a different bus from Sevilla to Tarifa, then transferred to a ferry that took us across the Mediterranean to Tangiers, Morocco! It was quite the journey, about 9 hours in all, but it was well worth it. Morocco is an entirely different world compared to Spain despite the proximity. We managed to ride camels by the beach, shop in the markets near the Medina, go on tours through the cities of Chefchaouen &amp; Assilah, and try traditional Moroccan cuisine such as couscous, slow roasted chicken and curry, batbout, and loose-leaf tea.&nbsp;<div><div><br /></div><div>The following week was pretty slow in the lab. It was the week of Corpus Christi and the annual fair, the biggest holiday in Granada at least. CIMCYC was closed Wednesday-Friday, and hey, I wasn't complaining about having a break from the lab. Kyra and I got the chance to explore the festivities of the holiday, which basically last for a week. On Wednesday we were able to see a parade through town of giant mannequins of kings and queens and a woman sitting atop a dragon. There were also people walking the streets with giant paper mache heads. &nbsp;I asked at least five different Granadinos what the significance was-- no one knew!&nbsp;</div><div>Here's a picture of the woman and dragon- the main event:</div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/10488079_10152211455920679_4818520651461273248_n.jpg"><img alt="10488079_10152211455920679_4818520651461273248_n.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/10488079_10152211455920679_4818520651461273248_n-thumb-200x150-401942.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a><div>That Thursday we went to the fair on the outskirts of town. There was an amusement park, open tents for dancing sevillanas (the traditional dance of Andalucia), and people riding around on horses in all different directions. The women wore traditional clothing, there were dance performances, concerts, and lots of beer and cured ham. Very Spanish I'd say.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I ended up posting more fliers (for the 4th time), because after the fair ended, finals were also coming to a close. I was hoping more students would be interested in my study considering they'd finally have more time on their hands. Despite the fliers, it was a pretty slow week last week as well. Thankfully, at the fair Kyra and I had met a Granadino who was bilingual in Spanish and English! I had decided to ask him if he wanted to participate in my study, and he did along with two of his bilingual friends! Sometimes the best way to recruit is just by talking with people.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Back to travels for little.. Kyra and I spent a beautiful five-day weekend in Sevilla, then Lagos, Portugal. We took a bus to Sevilla to explore the city for a few days and meet up with friends for tapas (BEST tapas of Spain by far). We then took a second bus to Lagos to enjoy a relaxing weekend at one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. We went kayaking and snorkeling and had the chance to see the sunset at the farthest point of southwest Portugal. It was thought to be the end of the world before the discovery that the world was round. It was a very cool sight to see. Here's a picture of me at Lagos:</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/10486077_10152211485575679_992259778298672462_n.jpg"><img alt="10486077_10152211485575679_992259778298672462_n.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/10486077_10152211485575679_992259778298672462_n-thumb-200x150-401940.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div>Onto the topic of the title of this post, it's my last week of research! I'm sad to say the least. This experience has gone by so fast, as life always does, and I'm completely blown that tomorrow will be my last day at the lab. I'll miss you CIMCYC! I have two more participants coming in tomorrow, which will make twenty-seven in total. I have surpassed my goal of twenty-five. All I need to do now is finish up coding the rest of my data, and I will be set to start working in the BiLD lab again in the fall to analyze everything.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Happy July everyone and I hope your summers are as fantastic as mine!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">Hello
again! I can´t believe it´s already July! I´m trying not to think about the
fact that this week is my last week of testing participants, but sadly it´s the
truth. I´ve now tested 30 participants. I have several more scheduled to come
in this week, and I´m hoping they all show up. Unfortunately my one participant
yesterday did not. I sent out reminder emails to the rest of my participants
for this week though, so I think that they will all come in. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">In
the past week, Paige and I went to Sevilla and Lagos. We met a ton of new
people at our hostel who were very friendly. We went out with several of them,
and we even met up with some of our friends that we met in Morocco. While in
Sevilla, I saw the Alcazar and the Cathedral. I also had some of the most
delicious tapas that I've had so far here in Spain. We were only in Sevilla
from Wednesday night until Friday afternoon, but we still managed to explore
the city and go on a walking tour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">After
our brief time in Sevilla, we headed to Lagos. Lagos is an absolutely beautiful
beach town. The sandy beaches were a sight to see when we arrived. We got to
walk along the beach for a little before we went out to dinner with the group.
When we finally went to dinner, Paige and I met some new friends from around
the US. We went to a restaurant called NahNahBah which had the best burger I've
ever had. It had the usually toppings of cheese, lettuce, and tomato, but it also
had bacon and pineapple. The combination of toppings was perfect. It turns out
the owner of the restaurant is from Massachusetts. We weren't the only ones who
loved the burgers either. This restaurant was voted one of the top 50 burger
joints in the world. The group got to go out together after dinner as well. We
went to a few different bars around town, and then we went to a club to go
dancing. It was all very fun. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">On
Saturday, I went on a sailboat cruise with part of the group who was in Lagos. We
got to take small speedboats into the caves to explore. They were all very
beautiful. After the cave exploration, we went onto the bigger sailboat and got
to jump into the ocean. It was freezing, but very refreshing and fun. We jumped
in the water several times before we headed to the beach to take in the sun. I
went in the ocean for a little bit, and we all had a great time relaxing in the
sand. After leaving the beach and cleaning up, the group headed to the "end of
the world" to see the most southwestern point in Portugal that people once
thought was the end of the world. It was beautiful, and we got to watch the
sunset despite some clouds. The group then went out to dinner again and then to
another bar in town.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">On
Sunday, Paige and I went kayaking. That was so exciting. I had never been
before, and I was very eager to try it. We paddled through the caves again and
then stopped on a beach to go snorkeling. I've done that before, but it´s been
many years. I forgot how difficult it was to remember only to breathe out of
your mouth. We got to see some fish and some sea anemone. Our one friend has a
GoPro camera so he took a bunch of underwater pictures. I'm eager to see how
they turned out. After our excursion we headed out to lunch, at NahNahBah
again, and then back to the hotel to head home. We took the bus to Sevilla and
then caught another bus back here to Granada.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">I
don't officially know what my plans are for this weekend and next week, but I'm
hoping to go to Madrid and Barcelona in the last few days. It would be a shame
to leave Spain before I saw the two largest cities. I'll keep you all posted
about my last adventures. Happy July everyone!</span><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_7553.JPG"><img alt="IMG_7553.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/IMG_7553-thumb-200x150-401938.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0px auto 20px;" height="195" width="261" /></a></p>

We met the renowned Dr. Pieter Muysken and shared information about our research with his lab. We were welcomed with smiles and after the presentation received encouraging advice for how to continue to analyze our data from Palenque. I've officially finished coding, and am in the beginning stages of analysis. Thus far I am faced with an interesting dilemma: I have so much data that I often don't know where to begin each time I look at it. However, I continuously stumble upon new and interesting realizations. Today, Dr. Muysken helped me to sift through the vast sea of questions that I am encountering. I am thankful for the opportunity to be working with him.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">My second favorite thing that happened this week was a trip to Berlin, Germany. This was our third trek to Germany since arriving in NIjmegen, (the first was a bike trip, the second a day trip to Cologne) and I'm loving our neighboring country more and more each visit. We went on a three hour walking tour of Berlin during which we saw the Berlin Cathedral, part of the Berlin wall, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and Checkpoint Charlie. We also stood on the land under which Hitler's bunker resided, where he committed suicide in 1945. To my surprise, we also saw the hotel where Michael Jackson held his baby from the balcony. I was also able to meet up with another friend from Penn State while there, making the trip even more fun and special! </span></p><br /></span> <div><span id="docs-internal-guid-41557d91-ef31-a0c7-2a89-494bd09e4728"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/I-gm9Np91Cy5ILCEyvCyxWTmHNou3HiMmGrbwWtpwRCO06EwNOLibWMwsXQWYP8FnB4xlKOQxIqdWd3fL3ot5Hf9uoHs-lvnBvdO4Lx908Brp0rqAHiFhcTrdEf-GH0Stg" width="624px;" height="468px;" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" /></span></span></div>]]></description>

            <title>Hup Holland!</title>
            <description><![CDATA[







<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fours weeks have gone by so fast. One of my favorite things about being in Europe right now is the World Cup. So far I have travelled to Belgium, Germany, and of course the Netherlands and everywhere I go I feel the pride of each country that I would not be as obvious if the tournament was not going on. Unfortunately, our latest trip to Berlin had us arrive after the Germany vs USA game, but we still got to see endless amounts of people sporting Germany jerseys, probably traveling somewhere to watch the game at an outdoor display. We did get to watch Holland beat Chile at an outdoor display that was in a square in the center city of Nijmegen. I felt immersed in the culture wearing a Holland scarf standing in a sea of orange jerseys and countless other orange attire. The celebration after the win was a really unique experience. Walking through the streets was just a giant Holland party.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This past weekend Jenny, Danny, Mary Beth, and I went to Berlin. We took a walking tour during which we got to see and hear about the rich history of the city. It was strange to me to be in a place where the history was still very recent. I think of WWII being so long ago and it is very easy to think about it as ancient history since it didn't affect my life, but it's events still affect the city today. Buildings that were bombed were still being rebuilt, the Berlin wall is still standing in parts of the city, and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe was only finished in 2004. The city was enormous. Only now do I appreciate how peaceful Nijmegen is. It is the perfect size for biking and although it is a city full of college students it is still quaint and relaxing. It feels like home when I come back from such large, busy cities.</span></p><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/10509610_10201276439513461_5800578788773496862_n.jpg"><img alt="10509610_10201276439513461_5800578788773496862_n.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/10509610_10201276439513461_5800578788773496862_n-thumb-200x150-401918.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></div><div>







<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Danny, Mary Beth, and I presented our research at a biweekly Radboud CLS meeting. I was a little bit nervous, especially because that was the first time we met our advisor, the renowned Pieter Muysken. My nervousness quickly disappeared after the presentation because all the professors were so personable and genuinely interested in our projects. We had lunch with a few of them afterwards and again they liked hearing about our research as much as we liked hearing about their backgrounds. Today was our first meeting with Prof. Muysken. Until today I have been very flustered as to how to analyze some of the data I collected. A part of my experiment involves my participants correcting sentences and due to the amount of variation I received there are many ways that it can be coded, too many actually. However, Prof. Muysken gave me very good advice for how to approach breaking down those complicated responses. The next weeks are going to involve a lot more coding and correspondence with Prof. Muysken. I am excited to see what else I find in my data.</span></p></div><div><br /></div>]]></description>

            <title>Finally days in Lund, Sweden </title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">My last &nbsp;week in Lund has finally come. It has been so easy to get lost out here and disconnect from world ( causing my lack of blogging ;) ) The people here live a calm lifestyle which at first I didn't understand. I was confused when I would get on public transportation and it was silent &nbsp;or &nbsp;see many people out to eat by themselves &nbsp;( and not pretending to be busy on their phones ) Back at Penn State I'm studying speech pathology. Every course that I've taken the teacher always reminders us that the first step is diagnosing a speech disorder is deciding if the patient has a "speech disorder or a speech difference." If your patient is pronouncing "dawg" instead of "dog" it might be because they have a problem with their speech or &nbsp;they simply live in New York City and have formed an accent. As my time passed in Lund I began to apply this lesson to my life. Many Swedish people aren't going to make small talk on the bus with you not because they don't like you but because many Swedish people are shy and don't want to bother a complete stranger. Also eating &nbsp;alone &nbsp;doesn't make you anti-social or lack friends, some people simply want to some alone time that happens to be in public. I could go on and on about all the cultural difference I've experienced while aboard. &nbsp;I think what I'll take away from this experience is that nothing is wrong with your own culture or the new culture you are in. It's just different and seeing these differences is a beautiful thing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This past weekend was Midsommar! This a holiday celebrating the first day of summer. It was a fun day filled strawberries, flower crowns and dancing around the maypole. My roommates and I went to a traditional maypole dance where we tried to follow the locals in their dances. Later that night we had a big dinner at home. Once we were free from our food coma&nbsp;we went out to pick flowers for our flower crowns. The Swedish people believe that on Midsommars night you should place seven different flowers from seven different fields under your pillow. That night you will dream of the man you're meant to be with. &nbsp;Unfortunately for me I dreamt of my mother! But besides that it was a lovely day and a successful Midsommar.<o:p></o:p></span></p><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/MD%40.jpg"><img alt="MD@.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/MD@-thumb-200x112-401833.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Sunday, my departing day, will be bittersweet. I am meeting my mother in Paris. We will spend 3 days there and then head to Ireland to visit our family. As excited as I am for the trip I will miss the friends I've made here. My roommates have been so wonderful. Everyone came from somewhere different . There was Louise, the local Swedish girl who would grow almost all her food and was a "extreme recycleist. " but would never force &nbsp;her extreme lifestyle onto you. She is a great listener and never made a promise she couldn't keep. There was Anna, a PhD student from German. I've never seen a girl &nbsp;eat so much and remain so thin. She spoke her mind and also took everyone's opinion into account. She made everyone feel welcome no matter where she went. &nbsp;Lastly there was Kelly, a girl from the Atlanta. When I first arrived I thought we were have so much in common. As we got to talking we found out we had such different views and lifestyles. Almost every night we would eat dinner t</span></p><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/midsommar%201.jpg"><img alt="midsommar 1.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/midsommar 1-thumb-200x112-401828.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">ogether. I think that's what I'll miss the most. Our talks over dinner would last hours discussing anything from the perfect time to have coffee to political views. The dinner table was just one giant melting pot of culture. No one was right and no one was wrong, just honest.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p><br /></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p><br /></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p>Friday I will finish my testing! I will end with 20 participants. Although it doesn't seem like a whole lot I am thrilled to end with this many people. &nbsp;Battling against finals and specific &nbsp;requirements made recruiting difficult at times. &nbsp;I was informed that an abstract &nbsp;I submitted to the Mental Lexicon in Queen lakes Canada was accepted ! Lots to look forward to in the coming school year. I know I am first finish my Pire experience. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience . &nbsp;Best wishes to all other students! Take it all in, it goes fast :)&nbsp;</o:p></p> ]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hello, readers. It´s been a little while
since my last blog post. Things have been good here in Granada. I just finished up
my 26<sup>th</sup> participant, so I have officially reached my goal number for
participants! I´m very excited about that. I have around 9 more people
scheduled though, so I´ll be busy next week finishing up my experiment. I´m sad
to say my time in Spain is running out. In just about two weeks I´ll be
boarding my plane home to Pennsylvania. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The past two weeks have been very eventful.
Two weekends ago, Paige and I were in Morocco. It was quite the experience. It
was a long journey to get there, but the reward was great. It was so amazing to
see a new continent. The culture was so different from Spain's. The food was
all very good. We ate a lot of bread, meat, and salads. Everything was very
flavorful. The most popular spice was curry. While we were there, we got to
shop in several different cities, tour Chefchaouen and Asilah, and ride camels.
The camel ride was my favorite. It was so much fun. Here's a picture of me right after the camel stood up. <br /></span></p>

<a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/camel.jpg"><img alt="camel.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/camel-thumb-200x142-401826.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="142" width="200" /></a>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This past week was Corpus Christi, so
CIMCYC was closed Wednesday through Friday. Paige and I were happy to have some
time off. On Wednesday we saw the parade which featured people running around
with large papier </span><span lang="EN-US">m</span><span lang="EN-US">âché-type heads. Thursday was the actual holiday, so
everything in the city was closed. We spent the day inside, but we went to the
fair that night. It was fun. There was music, dancing, food, games, carnival
rides, and horses- tons of horses. We spent several hours there on Thursday,
and we returned on Saturday to enjoy the merriment again. We sampled a chato
which was a small shot of very sweet wine that is typical for the fair. It was
very strong, but we were told we had to try it to truly get into the spirit of
the fair. The fair was much more crowded on Thursday than Saturday, but we
enjoyed ourselves both days nonetheless. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On Sunday, Paige and I went to the beach
again. This time we went to Salobreña. It was pretty cloudy, but we still managed to get a little sunburn. I'm thankful I was
wearing sunscreen because I can only imagine what I would have looked like if I
hadn't been wearing it. We were told that the next day was the celebration of
San Juan and that there would be many fires built on the beach to celebrate,
but unfortunately Paige and I had to work and couldn't go. It seemed like fun,
but we were able to go to a free, outdoor concert last night instead to
celebrate. The singer, whose name we didn't catch, was very talented. She sang,
played guitar, and played piano. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Neither Paige nor I have any participants
scheduled for the rest of the week because we are planning another trip.
Tomorrow and Thursday we are hoping to spend some time in Sevilla. Then, Friday
through Sunday we are going to be in Lagos, Portugal. We are going on the trip
with the same company that took us to Morocco, so we are very excited. It
should be a blast. We'll get to spend some time on the beach and maybe do some
kayaking or surfing. <br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Happy Summer, everyone!</span></p>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I often feel that, after a certain
amount of time in a city, one tends to forget what's great about that city.
When I first came to Mannheim, everything about it was new enough that I was
always excited to go exploring and there seemed to always be new things that I
hadn't seen yet. Sometime around one or two weeks ago, I stopped feeling like
there were new things that I hadn't seen and I was more content to stay in my
apartment and do work rather than try to find new things to do or even
different, local places to sit with my computer and get things done. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Yesterday Molly and I decided
though that we would try to do a bit more sightseeing in our last few weeks and
we went to Herzogenriedpark, the local park that lies halfway between our two
apartments. I had wanted to go to the park before, as it was only about 15
minutes away from my apartment, but the entry fee always deterred me. Why, I
thought, should they charge me to go into a green space? But once we got there,
we saw it was in fact much better; Herzogenriedpark is an extensive set of
grounds that has everything from a tremendous rose garden, to a sizable jungle
gym with a climbing rope web that was nearly two stories tall. There was entry
into a pool area with slides, as well as an area for minigolf, and even a
petting zoo! (One of the goats was nice enough to smile for me when I took his picture.)</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/image%20%285%29.jpeg"><img alt="image (5).jpeg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/image (5)-thumb-400x400-401800.jpeg" width="400" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: 0.5in;">We ended up spending nearly four hours in the park, spending a
large of that time eating blueberry cake and listening to Blasmusik
(traditional German polka) with over a hundred senior citizens and playing in
the big giant rope web. The weather was tremendous and the park has numerous
lounge chairs that are available to park-goers to sit in and sunbathe by the
fountains or gardens; after Molly left, I ended up grabbing a chair and sat out
read my new copy of "Die Tribute von Panem" (the German version of "The Hunger
Games").</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/image%20%286%29.jpeg"><img alt="image (6).jpeg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/image (6)-thumb-650x148-401802.jpeg" width="650" height="148" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I wish that I had realized earlier
how great the park was and that it was absolutely worth the cost of entry for
all of the great things that they have to do there--especially on a Sunday. In
Germany, as with many other European countries, the vast majority of things are
closed on Sunday and there's not much to do except stay at home or spend time
outside. The streets are usually fairly empty and I always imagined that people
stayed in with their families. I was wrong--it seemed like everyone in the city
had gone to the park, just as we had. It was really enjoyable to see people out
and being with their families in a green space and taking advantage of the
great things that Mannheim has to offer. Molly and I have plans to go back a
few more times before the summer's over--and I'm so excited!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: 0.5in;">One of the undisputed perks of being
in Europe is that everything is close by (relatively speaking). My dad is
currently living and working in Milan, Italy in a three-year position with his
company. As I didn't have any participants on the Friday leading up to the
weekend, I decided on a fairly spontaneous trip down to Milan to go see him! (Fortunately
my father's company was generous enough to offer to pay for my train fare there
and back, so it ended up being a super cheap trip!)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I always marvel at the stark
contrast between geographic proximity and cultural variety that Europe offers.
That is, that even though Italy lies just a few hours beyond the German border,
the cultures are very different. As soon as we crossed over into Italy, the
Italian police came on the train at every stop and walked up and down the
aisles--something that has never happened to me on a train in any of the other
countries I've been in in all my time in Europe. When I began to speak to one
of the officers in German (we had just crossed over from Switzerland, so I
figured that was my best bet), asking a question about my American ID, he
stopped me mid-sentence saying, "I do not speak German. I do not speak English.
You must ask someone else," and promptly walked away. While I of course do not believe
that his curtness is representative of the larger Italian population, it was a
stark reminder that crossing a border often means a change in customs. </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 1em; text-indent: 0.5in;">Despite my run-in with the rather
unfriendly policeman, I ended up having a really terrific time; two of my
friends I met last year in Germany were also free for Pfingsten, or Pentecost,
and decided to meet me for the weekend. We were able to fit a lot into the
weekend--shopping and sightseeing in Milan and taking a daytrip to the nearby
town of Stresa. Luckily the weather stayed nice for us (I even got a sunburn,
despite predictions that it would thunderstorm the entire weekend). My dad,
having already lived in Milan for several months before we came, was able to
show us some of the things to see in the area and give us tips on what to do
and where to eat.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/image%20%283%29.jpeg"><img alt="image (3).jpeg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/image (3)-thumb-700x232-401794.jpeg" width="700" height="232" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">My trip ended up also being a
really nice break in the monotony of life in Mannheim and was a good
opportunity to practice the ten words of italiano I know. (Those being the
words for basic foods and drinks, and how to order said items--you know, the
important stuff.) While I love practicing any of the languages I know
(basically just German and un peu French) I often foret how debilitating it can
be to not understand what people are saying. I take for granted understanding
what people are asking me in Germany; several times in Italy when I was spoken
to in rapid Italian I was forced to shrug my shoulders and offer only a
helpless deer-in-the-headlights stare back, at which point they were forced to
mime everything for me. I don't really find it embarrassing--there will always
be languages I don't speak and it won't stop me from traveling and trying to
experience the culture--but it sure is nice to be able to answer people in their
native language and have my food or drink served exactly as I would like it. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My time here is quickly coming to an end, but I am very
happy with the status of my research.&nbsp; I
ran a total of 26 participants, despite all the final exams students were
taking during the time I was here.&nbsp; I'm
hoping for a few more people, but I feel pretty confident that even with these
26, I will have sufficient data to analyze.&nbsp;
So far my participants have shown pretty interesting and diverse
results, and I have come to the conclusion that time in a foreign country
(years even) does not guarantee native-like speech (and sometimes it barely
helps).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My
adventure of the week consisted of getting my haircut while I was here.&nbsp; I shaved my head for Penn State's THON this
past February, and I haven't had a haircut since.&nbsp; It was getting to the point where I was
clearly growing a mullet and I really needed a trim.&nbsp; I met up with an old family friend that
actually studies here at Mannheim, and we found a hair dresser that was very
sweet and patient with me as I tried to use my German.&nbsp; The haircut ended up very chic and although a
little shorter than I would've liked, my mullet is gone!&nbsp; In this hot weather, having short hair has
been really convenient and really nice; plus a lot of Germans have short hair
like mine.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must say
that Abby and I were incredibly lucky here in terms of the weather.&nbsp; Of the entire trip, only two days were
considered "bad" and that was simply because it was 95 degrees out.&nbsp; It's been sunny and perfect weather to roam
around the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; This past Sunday,
since every store is closed here and the weather was great, Abby and I decided
to explore a nearby park.&nbsp; This was
definitely one of the coolest parks I have been to.&nbsp; It had a music hall with performances, really
good cake to eat while watching the performance, a jungle gym for kids,
mini-golf, and even a petting zoo.&nbsp; It
was beautiful day to roam around the park and just enjoy the weather and summer
day.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been
really great having a friend here to explore the city with.&nbsp; It gets lonely on weekends while we are doing
work in our apartments, so we've found a temporary home in Starbucks where we
are able to meet and get work done (the Wi-Fi is terrible, so we can't
procrastinate on Facebook or Twitter).&nbsp; It
makes being in a foreign city much more fun when you have someone to share the
experience with.&nbsp; It was also very nice
to have each other for motivation.&nbsp; There
were many days where I wanted to sleep the day away, but Abby and I always made
sure to make plans the day before and stick to them.&nbsp; It definitely kept us moving and made our
time here much more enjoyable.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can't believe how lucky I am. I am living in the Netherlands, in the biggest apartment I've ever lived in, stepping out onto our 11th floor balcony every morning and watching the Dutch do what they do best: biking. Simultaneously, I am learning more than I could have ever imagined about more than I ever thought I would.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the first day here, I was blown away by the beauty of this country. It is wonderful in all its modesty. While I love visiting the city center and seeing the old square lined with brick buildings, decked out in red shutters and topped in stepped gable (classic Dutch architecture), I really enjoy wandering on the residential streets where each house almost always has a sweet little garden out front which have the most perfect flowers (what girl doesn't love flowers). I don't know what it is about the flora here but even the wildflowers are more beautiful than anything I would be able to grow back home. Maybe it's because 50% of the country is less than one meter above sea level.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/Nijmegen/IMG_2073.JPG"><img alt="IMG_2073.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/IMG_2073-thumb-200x150-401763.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What a transition it was to come here after spending two weeks in Colombia. Third World to First World, extreme humidity to chilly and breezy, fruits and starches to fried food, Spanish to Dutch/French/English/German and many more. I never expected that I would get involved in linguistics (in fact I didn't even know what linguistics is a few years ago) but how could I not have, when I am blown away every time I am greeted in public in more than one language. Hallo, bonjour, hoi! Take your pick.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As far as my project goes, I am currently in the process of coding the data I collected in Colombia. I have a great time going through the recordings and remembering all the people I met there. The coding process so far is time consuming but interesting since I can already get an idea of how my results will turn out. Aside from this independent work, Daniel, Mary Beth, and I have attended a number of CLS talks and even a dissertation defense. The Radboud professors have been so nice for willingly getting in contact with us and inviting us to presentations and or meet us in person and even for setting up a chance for Daniel, Mary Beth, and myself to present our projects at their CLS meeting next week.&nbsp;</span></p> ]]></description>

With my roommate and fellow researcher, Mindy, I reminisce about Palenque, code interesting data, and attend CLS meetings. We even attended a dissertation defense (see Danny's blog)! </span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">In addition to working on our data, we enjoy exploring this beautiful city. We've wandered through parks and discovered that Holland is filled with beautiful flowers, peaceful reading locations, fiets (bikes) and adorable puppies. We also love visiting the nearby grocery store, Albert Heijn, where we are surrounded by hamsters (Holland's soccer team mascot) and the color orange, and where it is easiest to learn some Dutch vocabulary. </span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">We have also begun to venture outside of Nijmegen. Last week, Mindy, Danny, Jenny and I hopped on a train to another city in Holland, Den Haag. We visited the Peace Palace and Madurodam where, surrounded by adorable children whose enthusiasm paralleled our own, we explored Mini Holland. This was a great way to start planning future Holland excursions, as well as a fun way to learn more about the Netherlands and its history/culture. We also ate lunch at a seriously cute (it was pink) restaurant where I had my first piece of delicious Dutch apple pie! </span></p><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Additionally, Mindy, Jenny and I spent this past weekend in Belgium. With only a few days in the country, we visited Brussels, Bruges and Ghent. We did things the touristy way: went on tours, ate lots of chocolate, sampled the typical Belgian dishes (Waterzooi and beef stew with beer sauce), shamelessly ate Belgian waffles on more than one occasion, and altogether had an incredibly memorable weekend. </span></span> ]]></description>

            <title>Nijmegen, the Netherlands</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">First off, right out of the gate, as a budding linguist it seems appropriate to share that the city is pronounced NIGH-may-hen (and depending on what part of the country you're from there's some variation with the final "-gen"), but never a hard "j" in "Nij-." And that's about the entirety of my knowledge of Dutch. As many Dutch people have told me, the Dutch enjoy speaking English and can occasionally be impatient with foreigners attempting to practice Nederlands (or how the Dutch say "Dutch" in Dutch). &nbsp;These interactions have happened of course, in English. Besides those minor and predictable linguistic differences, I have only good things to say about the people I've met so far -- in English or any other language. I've been in the country for about a week and half now, living (until tomorrow, actually) in a rented room of a wonderful host named Wibe (try pronouncing that one) near Nijmegen's city center. Beginning my stay off of Radboud University's campus has given me license to conduct a self-guided biking tour of the surroundings. What I've found are markets and parks and churches and trees and gardens and bridges with cityscapes and beaches and all of this appears almost impossibly beautiful. After we Americans accidentally bombed Nijmegen in World War II, mistaking it for a German stronghold (it IS very close to the border -- whoops), the Netherlands' oldest city had some cleaning up to do. And clean up they have. Old architecture and new, impressive infrastructure make Nijmegen a very nice place to live.&nbsp;</p></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="padding: 6px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-family: Times; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xLbsnOHphH8/U5xitSmDNXI/AAAAAAAAA08/GSL_fz9PdY4/s1600/2014-06-09+11.44.19.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-orig-src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xLbsnOHphH8/U5xitSmDNXI/AAAAAAAAA08/GSL_fz9PdY4/s1600/2014-06-09+11.44.19.jpg" height="126" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-xLbsnOHphH8%2FU5xitSmDNXI%2FAAAAAAAAA08%2FGSL_fz9PdY4%2Fs1600%2F2014-06-09%2B11.44.19.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="400" style="cursor: move;" /></a></p></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px; padding-top: 4px;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">view from the bridge into town</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The bike ride to campus isn't too bad on the eyes either. So far at Radboud the majority of my work has been independently transcribing and coding the data I collected in Colombia. I have, however -- alongside my fellow field-researchers Mary Beth and Melinda -- attended some meetings with presentations by members from labs with names spelled in colorful acronyms: LinC, CLS, MPI, and BRC. Just yesterday, the three of us were invited to a PhD dissertation defense, here called by the more friendly title, a "promotion." The event was held in a cosy auditorium on Friday afternoon. The candidate walked to the front with her two advisors. Suddenly, a bell sounded and room silenced. We were instructed to stand as a procession of important-looking people paraded from the doors adorned in the garb of the tradition of Middle Ages academia. In other words, they were wearing wizard robes. (<a href="http://marianvanbakel.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/defending-your-phd-thesis-the-dutch-way/">Here is an article</a>&nbsp;with a more thorough description, plus pictures!) &nbsp;The "examiners" asked the candidate questions about her work, mostly as a formality; she'd already made the grade. Although I didn't quite catch the portions presented in Dutch and Latin, after sitting through the ceremony and watching the new doctor of linguistics attach those three magic letters to her name, it was impossible not to get chills.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p></div><div class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">There's more a'coming. So, keep your eyes peeled for the next post from the Netherlands.</p></div> ]]></description>

            <title>The life in Spain</title>
            <description><![CDATA[The main theme here seems to be that we are already halfway through with our studies! Things have been running smoothly since my last post. I was a bit worried before about not finding enough bilinguals for my study. Luckily after I posted my fliers around town, the emails started pouring in. I had a very full week, testing 8 participants in 4 days. That´s a lot considering my study takes 2 1/2 hours per person. A week well spent in CIMCYC (the lab here). <br /><br />So far I have 19 participants down, and I´m hoping to test 6 or 7 more. I think I´m going to need to head out to post more fliers, because my email inbox has been pretty dry. Giulia and I are continuing to work together as well on rounding up bilinguals, so I´m not worried about finding enough people in time. As for coding... so much fun! But really, it´s not that bad. I´ve already coded a lot of my data and so far I´m liking what I see. Exactly what was expected. <br /><br />Today Kyra and I presented our studies to the lab during the weekly lab meeting. Everyone is quite interested in what we are doing here, especially because that was the first time we had introduced our studies to everyone. <br /><br />I feel like I´m in the homestretch here, or maybe I shouldn´t say that and jinx myself considering it´s Friday the 13th tomorrow! All in all, things are trekking along great. <br /><br />As for things outside the lab, Kyra and I have been traveling a lot. Last weekend was spent in Cordoba, a very unique city further northwest in Andalucia. We only stayed for a day and a half, but that was all that was needed. It´s very small city! Tomorrow we hop on a bus then a boat to spend the weekend in Northern Morocco. This will be a totally different experience from anything in my life thus far. We have to be very street smart, for it´s not the safest country, but I´m beyond excited to indulge in the rich culture! More to come on our Moroccan adventure. <br /><br />In the words of the Granadinos, ta luego!<br />]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Hello all. I've reached the halfway point
here in Granada, and I have to say, I'm in denial. I actually cannot believe
after all the work that went into preparing to leave, that I'm already halfway
through. So far I've tested 19 participants which, luckily, is about ¾ of the
participants that I need. So far I had one more no show, but at least this time
the participant told me before I left our apartment to go to the lab. I'm
definitely in a groove with testing participants, and I basically have it down
to a science. Gone are the nerves. All I have to think about during the
experiment is will the participant have good data, and not, where do I put this
electrode. I think that I am conversing with the participants in Spanish with
more ease. I find that I don't worry as much about whether I'm 100%
grammatically correct because chances are the participant knows what I mean and
will tell me how to correct what I said. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since my last blog post, Paige and I went
to Córdoba. It was a beautiful city. We got to tour the Mezquita/Catedral, and
I was also able to explore the Alcazar and the gardens. I took many pictures
there. Here's one from Saturday. We were originally planning to stay the entire
weekend, but we were able to see all that we wanted to see by Saturday
afternoon, so we came back to Granada early and enjoyed some relaxation time. Working
at the lab and also fitting in travel has been a bit exhausting, but I'm not
complaining! There are so many places to explore still, and I'm eager to fit
them all in before July rolls around. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

headed to Morocco. I am very excited. This is the trip that I think we have
been most looking forward to. It'll be our first time in Africa, and I think
that it will be amazing. It will be unlike anything we've ever seen before, and
bonus- we'll get to ride a camel. We received our itinerary Monday, and we will
be spending time in Tangier, Chefchaouen, and Asilah. Hopefully we'll be able
to sample some tea and also some couscous. I'm looking forward to this weekend
so much, and it will be a big reward after this long, busy week. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Tomorrow, Paige and I will be giving
presentations to the lab on our PIRE research. I am glad that I had a
presentation prepared already from one of our small lab meetings. I will let
you all know how that goes, but I'm not too nervous about it. I would be if it
had to be in Spanish, though. I don't think I have enough linguistics/science
vocabulary in Spanish to speak about my research for very long. I think that's
all for now. More on Africa to come in the next blog post. </span></p>

            <title>Life is Gouda</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Each week I'm here, I gain more respect for researchers. Talk about detail oriented! One small error can throw off an entire experiment. I've been running through my scripts over and over again trying to catch a missing letter or an incorrectly numbered sound file. Poor Sarah Fairchild, who's been helping me from State College, gets new scripts from me practically daily with an update of a new mistake I caught. I haven't quite figured out how I want to celebrate the day I make it through an entire experiment without an error message. My fingers are crossed that today is the day! It can be so disheartening getting an error message after spending hours combing through sound files to ensure everything will go smoothly. That's why it's awesome having Megan as a roommate. As a postdoc, Megan gives me a glimpse into the future I should expect as a researcher. Not only is Megan conducting her own PIRE experiment, but she's also working on a book chapter and reviewing articles. Last night, I watched her work on two computers simultaneously. If Megan can do all that, then I can overcome all the learning curves I'm experiencing with my single experiment.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>During the week I'm scouring Excel spreadsheets, but the weekends are typically filled with exploration. My friend Jackie has been studying abroad in Utrecht all of spring semester, and I spent one weekend with her. I've never had such a fun, spontaneous trip before! I finished my work on Friday early, and I decided to message Jackie to see what she was up to. Turns out, she was planning a bike trip from Utrecht to Gouda to Kinderdijk on Saturday, and she invited me to join. I slept over on Friday, and early Saturday, we went to the Dom tower and waited for her friend to join us. Her friend Zeynep had the common sense to tell us that attempting to bike to both towns was completely implausible. She convinced us to take the train to Gouda and then bike to Kinderdijk. Gouda was an adorable little town. Wheels of cheese are strung up between the buildings like Christmas lights, and cheese shops are everywhere. I was in heaven! There was no need for lunch after I sampled every type of cheese available in one of the shops. I was particularly fond of a type of Gouda cheese that was mixed with Rosemary. Before we made our way to Kinderdijk, I bought a small wheel for myself (I intended it to last a couple weeks, but I finished it in a couple days).</div><div><br /></div><div>The bike ride to Kinderdijk was the greatest part of my trip thus far. We rode past fields of cows, sheep, and horses. Many houses kept goats in their front yards, and one home even had a yard full of alpacas! Still, the strangest sight had to be the goats we saw relaxing on top of a trampoline. The towns were all so quaint, and I love the look of the houses made of stone or brick. I've never been a fan of the colonial style homes that are favored in the US, and I could easily imagine myself living in any of the houses that we passed. When we arrived at Kinderdijk, the field of windmills blew me away (no pun intended). The old windmills lining the river could not have been more picturesque. I even bought a pair of slippers that looked like wooden shoes in the gift shop to round out this quintessentially Dutch experience. After about an hour spent admiring the simple beauty of the windmills, we biked back to Gouda to catch a train home. Google Maps said the trip would take an hour each way. Nope. The entire bike ride was four hours round trip. By the time I arrived back in Nijmegen, I was feeling every minute of that bike ride. Forget mattresses; Tempur-Pedic should be in the bike seat business. Everything from the waist down was sore. I'm woefully out of shape, and my thighs and calves hurt so much that I wasn't sure I'd be able to walk the next day. Luckily I was, but I definitely wasn't moving too quickly. The soreness was worth it though. I saw more of the Netherlands in that one bike ride that I have during my entire stay. I can't believe I get to spend two months in this absolutely charming country!</div>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time is really flying by here.&nbsp; It's sad to think that I have to leave this
place in a month from today.&nbsp; The past
month that I have been here has been very enlightening and very
successful.&nbsp; As of right now, I have run
almost 20 participants, have another 5 signed up, and am waiting for 6 emails
back.&nbsp; I have learned exactly how
powerful Facebook and word of mouth can be!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than
running participants, Abby and I have gotten into a nice routine that keeps us
up and out of our beds day after day.&nbsp;
Our day normally starts with stopping at a Grimminger café (they are on
practically every corner) to grab my cup of coffee and head to our office and
wait for participants.&nbsp; We hang around in
the office until both of us are finished running participants, and then we
venture out into the city for groceries, or just to walk off that pastry we had
at lunch time.&nbsp; It's nice having someone
here with a very similar work ethic to my own.&nbsp;
We are both very eager to get out and to explore, but we also understand
that we are here for research and our participants and recruiting comes
first.&nbsp; Sharing the office can be
difficult at times when we have participants scheduled at the same time (and
you can hear through the walls), but we are both very lenient and always figure
out ways to share our space.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing
that I find refreshing here is that everything is closed down on Sundays; even
the public transportation runs a lot slower.&nbsp;
It's nice that people take a break once in a while.&nbsp; It was a bit frustrating at first when I was
in desperate need of groceries and there was no WalMart nearby to run to, but I
have learned to really appreciate the peaceful Sunday atmosphere and have
learned to stock up on food for the weekends.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's also
been refreshing not having my cell phone attached to my hips at all time.&nbsp; My generation is constantly on Facebook or
texting friends, and not having that here has been quite a relief.&nbsp; I've appreciated the silence and not the constant
buzzing of my phone, and it's been a nice break from reality.&nbsp; I've been able to experience things through
my own eyes rather than my cell phone camera.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that
this next month is going to go by in a blink of an eye, but I am excited to see
what the rest of this trip has in store for me and what else I can learn in
that month.<o:p></o:p></p>

            <title>Spain Week 3</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Hello all. Another great week has passed. Since I last
wrote, I have tested 7 more participants. They all went fairly well. I have 2 more
scheduled for this week which will bring my total up to 14 so far. I'm happy
with that number, but I'm eager to get closer to my goal. I have had two people
not show up in the past few days, so I'm hoping that does not happen too many
more times. I only have a limited amount of time to schedule participants, so
hopefully all my participants show up to their assigned times. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This past weekend was very eventful. I made it through the
week and was rewarded by our trip to the beach. Nerja was beautiful, as I
expected. Being that this is my first trip to Europe, it was my first time
seeing the Mediterranean. I was very excited to see it from the bus window
while we were driving along the coast. Paige and I stayed at a hostel in Nerja
for Friday and Saturday night. We did a lot of wandering around the town, and
we soon discovered that it is fairly small. It also has a lot of tourists, so
we were able to hear many different languages being spoken by everyone there. In
addition to spotting other foreigners in the town, we were also able to meet
some new people in the hostel. Paige and I spent some time with people from
England, Denmark, France, Australia, and Germany. The group of people consists
of people of varying ages and backgrounds, but we were all tied together by our
excitement about traveling throughout Spain this summer. Saturday was sunny and
hot, so Paige and I got to enjoy the sun and the waves on the beach for a
while. We also sampled some great foods, including waffles and ice cream and
churros. Unfortunately, Sunday was a rainy day, so Paige and I did not get to
spend very much time outdoors, but we had a very relaxing weekend as a whole.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_5879.JPG"><img alt="IMG_5879.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/IMG_5879-thumb-200x150-401659.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This past Monday was the day Paige and I finally made it to
the Alhambra. It was more beautiful, more intricate, and more breathtaking than
I could have imagined. Up until this week I had only seen a few pictures, but
they do not do the building and the gardens justice. The flowers and plants
smelled so fresh and delicious, and the only thing that was more amazing than
Generalife was being inside the Nasrid Palaces. The architecture was unlike
anything I had seen before, and I could do nothing but gawk and take pictures. It
is crazy for me to try to imagine that this building has been in Granada for so
long. Paige and I were very lucky to have gotten to take a tour, and we could
not have asked for more perfect weather either. I'm very glad that we bought
tickets. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After testing some more participants this week, Paige and I
are planning to head to Córdoba. We have been told by countless people that it
is a beautiful place to visit, and we are going to take everyone's advice. We
really are trying to take advantage of our weekends and travel as much as
possible. I'll be writing all about Córdoba next week I'm sure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p> ]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 1em;">Some of the initial excitement of being back in Germany has
started to wear off and I feel like I've really adjusted to life here in
Mannheim. I think that I was really very eager when I first arrived to see all
of the things that the city had to offer. Molly and I have since slowed down
and I think focused a lot on our studies and figuring out a routine. Everyday
consists usually of a breakfast coffee (for Molly) and a baked good (for both
of us). When we're not running participants, we typically stroll around or buy
groceries all whilst discussing the merits of different sandwiches at local
bakeries. I like that I've--we've--been able to sort of find a rhythm here; it
makes Mannheim somehow feel more like a home, and not just a place I'm
visiting.</font></p><font style="font-size: 1.25em;">

</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 1em;">I feel like I really lucked out too that Molly and I get
along so well and that she, like me, wants to spend time in the city and in
surrounding areas. While being with another person is not necessarily a
prerequisite for having fun or appreciating a foreign country, I think that
there's really something to be said about being able to share an experience
like this with another person. It's advantageous, too, in that that other
person can often be a motivating force behind getting up and leaving your
apartment on less busy days. There have been several days in which I haven't
had a participant scheduled where I may have been tempted to lay in bed or stay
in my apartment with my roommates, but having another person around who serves
as a reason to change out of my pajamas and spend some time in the city is
something I think I really needed and appreciate having.</font></p><font style="font-size: 1.25em;">

</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 1em;">It's great too that she lives in a complete different area
of the city from me. Because the commute takes about an hour (yikes)
from her apartment to mine, I wouldn't have otherwise ventured out to that part
of the city. I think it's easy when you travel to a new city to be somewhat
hesitant to go to parts that are far away or unknown (perhaps if only for the
reason that there's nothing terribly exciting or remarkable when you get
there). I like having an excuse to see more of the city than I might otherwise.
Maybe in the latter half of our trip we'll do a bit more exploring.&nbsp;</font></p>

            <description><![CDATA[I cant believe how fast time has gone here in Lund! I am happy to report that I have 4 participants completed. Everyone who has come is really excited to take part in the project. We are running into some issues. We are looking for Native Swedish &nbsp;speakers without any knowledge of the German language . But a&nbsp;large portions of Native Swedish speakers had to take German growing up. We are also competing with final schedules<div><br /></div><div>Yesterday was <span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">Ascension Day</span><font color="#454545" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp;here in Sweden. It marks the 40th day of Easter. It also means that the&nbsp;university &nbsp;was closed for the day! With this free time a friend and I headed into&nbsp;Malmo. Only a ten minute train ride made malmo an easy day trip. We spend time on the Western Harbor and had some lunch. The weather was a little chilly but most outdoor&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;provide blankets for customers ( how cute!) So we were were just fine. &nbsp;I plan&nbsp;on heading into&nbsp;Copenhagen</span></font><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;for the weekend as well!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/malmo.jpg"><img alt="malmo.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/malmo-thumb-200x112-401640.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A picture from the day trip!</span></div>]]></description>

            <title>Week 2 in Spain</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Hello again, PIRE blog followers. It has been another great
week here in Granada. Since I last posted I have already tested 4 participants.
I have been in contact with 37 interested participants, 29 of which are already
scheduled. I have been very lucky that there are so many willing participants.
I emailed a ton of people last week, and a lot of the people who responded also
said they had friends who would be interested as well. News of my study has
definitely spread through the university very quickly. I wasn't worried too
much about finding willing participants, but now that I've been in contact with
so many, I definitely feel more at ease. Most of my evenings and weekends are
spent organizing my schedule to fit participants. With the amount of people
that have responded already and the amount of time I have to test participants,
I might actually have to turn participants away come June. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since last week, Paige and I have done more exploring of the
city. We were even able to go out with a group of people from the lab because
Julia just defended her thesis this past Thursday. It was nice to get to meet
some new people who we haven't met yet and to get to know better those that we
have met. This past weekend Paige and I had the opportunity to hike the Sierra
Nevada. Our view of the city and the mountains was beautiful. Although we
didn't have any winter clothes, we still managed to make it pretty high up into
the mountains before we turned around. We took a ton of pictures. Here's one
that I took of our view.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/pic%20103.JPG"><img alt="pic 103.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/pic 103-thumb-200x150-401620.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1em;">Paige and I have a lot of fun things planned for the coming
week. Our tour of the Alhambra is next Monday, so I am very excited about that.
So far we've only been able to see the outside. It's magnificent, so I'm sure
the inside will be just as spectacular. We also planned a trip to Nerja for
this weekend. It's is a beach town not too far from here. The pictures we've
seen are beautiful, so we will definitely have pictures of our own to share
with you all next time. I will be testing 6 more participants before this weekend
though, so for right now, our trip seems like a long way away.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p> ]]></description>

            <title> A Week of Accomplishments</title>
            <description><![CDATA[I can't believe it's finally here! The day when I can safely say: No. More. Splicing. After hours upon hours spent breaking sentences up by the word, I have all my stimuli ready to go! I'm so excited to start running participants. Hopefully, I'll start to see some results in the next couple weeks, because I'll be presenting at one of Dr. James McQueen's biweekly lab meetings within the next month.<div><br /></div><div>Recruiting participants has been a slow process, but I'm got a couple great people helping me out. I have a few people lined up, and Megan has kindly offered to be my guinea pig for the trial run of the experiment. Fingers crossed everything goes smoothly! It's really amazing seeing everything come together after months of effort.</div><div><br /></div><div>This weekend, I finally got to see Nijmegen. I have absolutely no sense of direction, so I never ventured farther than the lab and the grocery store without Megan holding my hand (metaphorically speaking). On Saturday, we went into the city center to visit the market. My jaw dropped when we rounded that last corner and saw the line of booths. I couldn't believe it was the same city I've been living in the past two months! The only word I can think of to describe downtown Nijmegen is charming. The architecture, outdoor cafes, river, and trees all combine to give the city a feeling like it was pulled right from a fairy tale.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of fairy tale, the highlight of the journey downtown had to be our brief tour of the castle that was built by Charlemagne. I had read about the building in a guide to the Netherlands my mom got me for Christmas, and I was so excited to tour my first castle! I figured I'd spend a couple of hours wandering down drafty, stone corridors and climbing the winding staircases of turrets. I failed to consider the implication of touring a castle that was built almost a thousand years ago. Megan and I spent about thirty seconds walking around the curved brick wall that was the only remnant of the&nbsp;<font face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;">Kasteel het Valkhof. I couldn't help but laugh at my&nbsp;naivety.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;"><br /></span></font></div><div><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;">All in all, this has been a week of accomplishments. I finally finished preparing my experiment, and I finally saw the city I've called home the past two weeks. If my next five weeks are as productive as this one, I'll know Nijmegen better than I know Philadelphia, and I'll have plenty of good data to analyze!&nbsp;</span></font></div>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's hard to believe that I've already been in Germany for
almost two weeks.&nbsp; I guess that's what
happens when you're always busy!&nbsp; Abby
and I have been recruiting almost every day, but we're competing against final
exams at the moment, so it hasn't been going as smoothly as we liked.&nbsp; I've ran three participants this far, and I
am very happy with how things are looking.&nbsp;
I have two more lined up for next week at the moment, and hopefully I
get more people coming in as finals end for the students.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany is
truly beginning to feel like home.&nbsp; I've
conquered the German washing machines, the public transportation, and have been
a frequent customer at the local markets.&nbsp;
I've especially enjoyed trying to maintain a conversation with the
locals (they think I know more German than I really do, so I just smile and nod
most of the time). <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abby and I
were able to take some time to visit the beautiful city of Heidelberg, and it
was definitely an incredible trip!&nbsp; We
stopped by the Heidelberg Castle that was destroyed centuries ago, but the
parts that were preserved were not only incredibly interesting to hear about,
but they were incredibly beautiful.&nbsp; I
find it fascinating how two cities (Mannheim and Heidelberg) can be so
different but so close to each other.&nbsp; It
was definitely a neat cultural experience and I really enjoyed it! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the next
week approaches, I am aiming to get up to 10 participants and explore Mannheim
a little bit more.&nbsp; My time here has been
absolutely amazing and I am so thankful that PIRE has given me this
opportunity!<o:p></o:p></p>

            <title>Granada Week 1!</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Greetings from Granada! It has been a long but eventful week
since leaving the States. The flights to get here went as smoothly as they
could have. I was very lucky to have been awake not only to watch the sun rise,
but also to look out the window and see the very first glimpse of Europe as we
flew over the coast of Portugal. Getting to look down on a new continent was
very exciting. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So far, here in Spain, I have felt very welcomed. Manolo
gave me the grand tour of the apartment and has been very helpful in pointing both
Paige and I in the right direction to find the bus stop, the grocery store,
good places to eat, etc. He brought us into the lab this past Thursday and we
were able to meet Teresa and many other people who work in the lab. Everyone
was very welcoming and helped us whenever we needed assistance with anything
which is good because we seem to have a lot of questions. The facility itself is
gorgeous inside, but it has an even more amazing view of the city. We were able
to see the rooms where we will be working for the next 7 weeks, and we were
also able to attend the weekly lab meeting.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the cultural front, I have slowly been getting used to
living here in Granada. The jet lag that was around for the first few days has finally
disappeared. I'm not quite used to taking a siesta and eating dinner at 10 pm,
but I'm sure I will be in due time. I have taken the opportunity to walk around
the city as much as possible this week. So far Paige and I have seen beautiful
views of the Alhambra, the Cathedral, the Sierra Nevada, and many other
wonderful parts of the city. We're planning on taking tours of all Granada's
landmarks and taking as many pictures as we can. We even booked our ticket to
see the Alhambra. Much to our surprise, tickets were sold out until June. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm looking forward to testing participants. I started
sending out emails yesterday to recruit participants, and I already have 8
people scheduled. It's very exciting. Hopefully I continue to find willing
participants. Granada is, after all, teeming with monolingual Spanish speakers.<o:p></o:p></p>

            <title>Week One in Granada: Complete!</title>
            <description><![CDATA[It's hard to believe that a week has already gone by! I'm starting to feel much more accommodated here, and I'm learning how to navigate myself around the city like a local. Not really.. But I know how to get to my apartment without a map!&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Manolo, my host who is also a member of the lab here, gave me and Kyra a grand tour of the department building last Thursday. Let me just say, el Centro de Investigación Mente, Cerebro Y Comportamiento (CIMCYC) is a BEAUTIFUL building. Every thing is new, and white, and clean and it's situated on top of a hill that has a great view overlooking Granada. This is what we see from the balcony outside our assigned lab room:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/P1050640.JPG"><img alt="P1050640.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/P1050640-thumb-200x150-401517.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a><div>We also had our first lab meeting last Thursday. Everyone is very warm and welcoming. It's funny to me how similar the lab here is to the BiLD lab. Everyone speaks AT LEAST two different languages almost fluently, and the set up of the lab meetings is basically the same. Sitting in the lab and watching how people test participants is exactly the same procedure as well. It's actually pretty cool.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm starting to schedule participants to come in for my study, and I'm getting way more excited and giddy than I thought I'd be. I have two people scheduled already. I'm looking forward to running through the study with a real participant for the first time, woohoo!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Until next time,</div><div>Paige</div>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">It's already been six days since I've arrived in Mannheim and
I feel like time has flown. I spent my academic year last year in Germany and
it feels so great to be back. Mannheim is a really terrific city but is much
different from Freiburg--where I stayed during my year abroad--in that it feels
somehow much more industrial. From nearly every point in the city you can see
one of the big giant cranes that are spread out along the harbor, and while
there are green areas in the city, I'm not constantly surrounded by forest and
mountains like I was last year. (Freiburg, unlike Mannheim, lies directly in
the Schwarzwald, or Black Forest.) Mannheim has its own quirks though: It
offers a more modern take on German city life and is also home to many people
of Turkish heritage, which I find really cool. There are places in the city
that have streets of Turkish bakeries and restaurants and where all the signs
are in Turkish. To me, it's reminiscent of areas like Chinatown in New York
City and I'm eager to explore these areas more (and hopefully locate a really
terrific D</font></span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">öner in the process).</font><o:p></o:p></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image (1)-401508.html" onclick="window.open('http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image (1)-401508.html','popup','width=640,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image (1)-thumb-300x300-401508.jpeg" width="300" height="300" alt="mannheim" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">What I really love about Mannheim is that it, like many other
German cities, also has frequent farmers' markets. The one here is three times
a week in the main square; everything from vegetables and fruits to fresh
cheese, bread, and big flower bouquets is available for purchase. Molly and I
went yesterday and I bought lots of fresh veggies. It was such a pleasure to be
able to cook for myself with all my fresh ingredients and I ended up eating
dinner with my Mitbewohner, or roommates, who funnily enough are two
engineering students from Alabama. They don't speak almost any German (which,
I'll admit is somewhat disappointing as I was hoping to practice my German at
home with my roommates) but it was fun trying to teach them German phrases and
spread some of my knowledge about Germany (for instance, buy anything you might
need for the weekend ahead of time as almost everything closes early Saturday
and completely on Sunday, and trying to find things like Lysol wipes or clothes
hangers at grocery stores is an exercise in futility). <o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 0.5120000000000001em;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">Another really tremendous thing about Mannheim is that it
lies a mere 30 minutes by Stra</font></span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">ßenbahn
away from</font> </span></font><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">Heidelberg. Molly and I make the trek out today and did a
tour of the Heidelberg Castle, which overlooks the Neckar and the rest of the
city. After going on a tour of the castle, we bummed around the city and did
some shopping.</font>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 0.5120000000000001em;"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image-401509.html" onclick="window.open('http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image-401509.html','popup','width=640,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image-thumb-300x300-401509.jpeg" width="300" height="300" alt="heidelberg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><font style="font-size: 1em;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">I really enjoyed being in Heidelberg because it feels much more
"German" to me. That is, it has the cobblestone streets and old façade look
that I really want from my German cities; until I went to Heidelberg, I hadn't
realized how much I missed that in Mannheim. Regardless of the lack of "German-ness"
(as I would call it) of Mannheim, I'm still very much enjoying my time here and
I'm eager to see more of what this city has to offer!&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>

            <title>Arriving in Beijing</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Arriving in Beijing on Monday was quite a culture shock!<div><br /></div><div>Surprisingly, I was not too jet lagged to start with. I think it helps that the time difference between State College and Beijing is exactly 12 hours, and since I didn't get much sleep before I drove to the airport at 4am Sunday (because I don't think it's physically possible to fall asleep before 11pm), <i>any</i>&nbsp;sleep I got on the plane from Dulles to Beijing was during nighttime in China. However, over the next few days, jet lag started kicking in, and around 3pm my body started to decide that even though I wasn't tired at all, I should desire nothing more than to go to bed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, I am insanely grateful that the advisor here, Taomei, asked one of her students, Jie, to meet me at the airport, because without that, there's no way I would have found my way to the apartment that I am staying at. Unlike my experience with many European languages, where if you speak slow each person can probably pick up enough cognates and hand gestures to make some basic communication, it's impossible to break the language barrier if you don't speak Chinese here. Most of the population knows only very basic English, if any at all, and since I know only a few phrases in Mandarin, it can be hard to communicate my intent and all but impossible to ask questions. Overall, having people who can speak both English and Mandarin come along with me has been almost a necessity in certain situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>The biggest thing I've noticed so far is that I certainly stand out as a foreigner. I've been told that the area I'm living in is made up of almost 100% Chinese people, so a white person is quite noticeable. Just walking down the street I've been getting quite a few intense stares of curiosity. I've gone to a few places for food a handful of times and even though I've only been here less than a week, the people working there already remember what I like to buy because I stand out so much! I've also had quite a few people timidly come up to me and ask if they can take pictures with me or of me and their kids. Since I'm fairly certain I'm not a celebrity here, I did some quick Googling and discovered that that's actually a pretty common experience among foreigners in China (apparently, the people who do this tend to also be tourists to the city and come from areas where foreigners rarely visit).</div><div><br /></div><div>Most people I've encountered do seem to be &nbsp;accepting of foreigners. There are some word that are incredibly hard to pronounce for an English speaker, such as baozi, which is a delicious little meat filled bread pocket. It's pronounced /bɑʊ.t͡sʐ/, and although I have no problem with the /t͡s/ (which is like an "sh" sound pronounced where you pronounce "s"), but going from that to a "z" sound is not something I'm capable of. Every time I struggle out my best pronunciation of the word, whoever I am ordering from is happy to repeat it slowly to let me listen.</div><div><br /></div><div>The food so far has been fantastic. I've tried literally everything I can get my hands on (and that's <i>a lot</i>&nbsp;of food). Compared to the United States, food is extremely cheap. Baozi is my favorite food by far, and it can be had for about 2 RMB or 0.32 USD. Not quite as steep as my $2 muffin every morning in State College at Au Bon Pain. There's a nearby road lined with market stalls selling a delicious variety of foods; I'm slowly making my way through trying everything.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2257.png"><img alt="A Bowl of Noodles from a Small Vendor" src="" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2254.png"><img alt="Bread Pocket with Chives and Egg" src="" width="200" height="266" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div>Meals in restaurants are also amazing, although they taste nothing like Chinese food in the US. They also seem to be very vegetable-heavy, which is quite a shock to a self-proclaimed carnivore like me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Chopsticks are also the hardest thing in the world to use. Seriously. If America wants to curb its obesity epidemic, it only needs to replace all forks with chopsticks. Luckily, since I've had quite a few meals with Mandarin-English bilinguals, they've been nice enough to ask for a fork when I start to struggle!</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't think this post really has a conclusion. And I think the whole thing was kind of rambled. But I'm still jet lagged and sleepy, and I'm totally going to use that as an excuse!</div>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After three days of running around
Germany, I can finally say that I have arrived and settled in safely!&nbsp; The flight started off quite
interesting.&nbsp; We were about to take off,
and as we were leaving, the pilot made an announcement that the breaks locked
up and we needed to turn around to get them checked out by maintenance.&nbsp; They said it would take about a half hour, so
I just pulled out my book and began to read.&nbsp;
That half hour turned into a two hour delay, but luckily I didn't have
to worry at all about a connecting flight.&nbsp;
Despite all the complaints from the people in the seats around me, I was
happy that the plane stopped to get things checked out; better safe than sorry!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Before the plane fiasco even
happened, I had a very interesting encounter in the airport.&nbsp; A bunch of my friends are traveling to Italy
for an HDFS minor program this summer, and I ran into one of them at the
Philadelphia airport.&nbsp; We then found out
that we were on the same flight!&nbsp; It
truly is a really small world!&nbsp; It was
nice to see a familiar face, but what was even better was that my fellow PIRE
peer, Abby, was on the flight with me.&nbsp;
It was nice to have someone familiar with Germany with me as I ventured
out to get the train from Frankfurt to Mannheim.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Upon arriving in Mannheim, I headed
straight for my apartment.&nbsp; I assumed
that they would be at the apartment waiting for me since they knew I was coming...but
I was wrong.&nbsp; I sat outside my apartment
for about an hour hoping they would stop by, and then I finally gave up.&nbsp; Abby and I went to buy our phones to reach
our participants, and attempted to call the apartment owner...but my phone didn't
work.&nbsp; Luckily, right down the street was
a small shop where you could make phone calls and use the computers.&nbsp; With Abby's help, we were able to contact my
landlord and he came right by to let me in.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Let me tell you, he sure came to
the apartment in style!&nbsp; He was driving a
convertible (the weather here is beautiful - 65 degrees and sunny) and as he
was going to park, he went too fast and ran straight into the back of the car
in front of him and then backed into his parking space like it was completely
normal to drive that way.&nbsp; After being
jet-lagged and awake for over 24 hours, I found it quite funny.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After all the fun of getting
settled in and exploring the city, it was time to meet up with Dr. Hopp and
start recruiting participants.&nbsp; He is so
tall that one of his strides was about 4 of mine, so I was practically running
around his building!&nbsp; He is really great
and really helpful, and I am very excited to get started actually running
participants.&nbsp; Recruitment starts
tomorrow, so wish me and Abby some luck!<o:p></o:p></p>

            <title>Arrived and Alive</title>
            <description><![CDATA[As the plane descended below the cloud line, I saw my first glimpse of the Netherlands! Two words immediately came to mind: lush and wet. There are open pastures, leafy trees, and rich shrubbery stretching for miles. Scattered between fields and roadways are canals; at least, I think they're canals. These bodies of water that are too big to be considered streams but too small to be considered rivers crisscross the countryside. The landscape is beautiful and unlike anything I've ever seen in the US.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Despite my absolutely awful sense of direction, I managed to make it on the train to Nijmegen without a hitch. I tried to keep my eyes open on the ride to the city so I could take in as much of the landscape as possible, but it was a lost cause. I did manage to note before I passed out with my head against the window how the line between rural and suburb seems pretty blurred over here. Fields of cows, sheep, and horses are located next to warehouses, towns, and train stations. From the window of my desk right now, it looks like the city of Nijmegen shares its location with a forest.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of my desk, the apartment Megan and I share is great! Megan met me at the train station, and the two of us took a ten minute taxi ride to an apartment building that looks like it's made of purple brick. All the doors to the apartment open with key fobs, so I feel really high tech every time I come home and wave my fob over the sensor to open the front door. We share a one bedroom apartment with a cozy living room and kitchen area. There's a nice, big desk where I'm currently writing this post. You can definitely tell this apartment is for visiting scholars though; the desk alone is almost as big as our kitchen! I think my favorite feature of the apartment is the funky bright red floor that matches our comfy living room chairs.</div><div><br /></div><div>After I napped for a couple of hours, Megan showed me the building where I will be working. It seems really nice! There's a cool indoor garden outside the cafe where I'll get lunch sometimes. Megan then took me to buy some groceries. I've lived on campus the past two years, so this was my first time ever attempting to stock a fridge completely on my own before. Add in the fact that everything was written in Dutch, and it was a recipe for disaster! Luckily, I had Megan to help me out. She has been absolutely amazing in helping me get around here. I wouldn't be able to function without her. Kudos to all the PIRE kids who are going at this alone! I hope your survival instincts are stronger than mine.</div><div><br /></div><div>While all things travel-related went smoothly, I've already suffered several technical difficulties. First, my personal laptop decided it doesn't want to work over here. It keep shutting down after a few minutes and now doesn't even recognize when it's being charged. Thank you, PIRE, for sending me abroad with two computers! The PIRE laptop works great; it's actually faster than my Mac. I just have to adjust from switching over from a Mac to a Dell. I had a minor issue with email yesterday too. For some reason, I was receiving emails without a problem, but I couldn't send any. Once again, Megan came to my rescue. Now I'm just hoping this post actually gets published. This is Take 2 of my entry, because the first one didn't save correctly. Now I know to copy a post in case it doesn't save once I attempt to send it out into the blogisphere. Live and learn! Speaking of learning, it's time to get back to my sentence splicing so I finish preparing my experiment. I'll be sure to post again soon!</div>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal">I wrote this blog over the weekend, but did not have internet access until now to post!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">My Hong Kong experience has been amazing. In just 8 quick
weeks I ran 18 participants, attended a conference, traveled all over the
island, ate all different types of food, and fallen in love with Hong Kong! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I feel very accomplished and proud of myself for being open
minded and taking advantage of each new opportunity. The first few weeks were
very challenging, but when I reminded myself that this is a once in a lifetime
opportunity, things became much easier. I came into this not knowing a single
person here. I have met some incredibly kind and genuine people from all over
the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have tested my limits
and learned what it is like to be truly independent. Mastering the public
transportation systems wasn't easy, but I finally almost know my way around
without getting totally lost! I feel extremely fortunate and blessed to have
had this experience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I couldn't have completed my research here without some
wonderful people at HKU. To Carol, Gary, Carmen, Ally and Chris: Thank you for
all of your help and time. You have each been so welcoming.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you so much to Dr. Miller for believing in me and
guiding me throughout the year. Working with you has been a great learning
opportunity and I am excited to return to continue this work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Last, but certainly not least I owe a HUGE THANK YOU to PIRE
for this incredible learning experience. This experience has challenged my
thinking and is a journey that I will never forget.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As things quickly end here, I am very excited for my mom's
arrival. We will be site seeing in Hong Kong for the next week and then
traveling to Beijing. I am looking forward to showing my mom everything I have
seen here. I have always wanted to walk on the Great Wall of China; it is
towards the top of my bucket list, but I never thought it would actually
happen. I am so thankful for each unique opportunity that I have experienced
here.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am excited to return back home and to State College, but
leaving Hong Kong will be difficult. This is certainly not goodbye to Hong Kong...
one day I will be back!</p>

custom to tip. This also means that waiters and waitresses do not check in
during your meal to see if you need anything. Most places I have to flag down
the waiter to order or pay. Free refills also do not exist here and to have a
drink with ice is extra charge!</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->People are buried vertically here. I was told
that it is because Honk Kong is such a densely populated area. I live next to a
cemetery and you can tell that they are buried vertically because the tombs are
so close to each other and run down hill.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Hong Kong has the most public holidays...14 I believe.
They celebrate both Chinese and English holidays. In just 8 weeks, I have been
here for 2 public holidays! </p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Monolinguals are almost non-existent. The only
people who only speak one language are "expats"...this is the term people here
use for foreigners. Everyone here speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, some English and
sometimes even 2-3 other dialects of Chinese. </p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Sunday= Maids day. Most families here have a
maid/helper that either lives with them or works for them part time. The
helpers are usually from the Philippines. Every Sunday, all of the maids have the
day off and gather all over Central. The women line the sidewalks and play
games, bring food and gather with each other for the day. It's interesting
seeing thousands of women line the streets...especially in this heat!</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Umbrellas are a necessity. It rains almost every
day here; it is currently typhoon season. I quickly learned how essential an
umbrella is! People don't just use them in the rain though! The people here,
especially the elderly use umbrellas on a daily basis and every time they are
in the sun. The elderly also use them as canes, which I think is a funny/cute
site to see. Some of the umbrellas are stunning...who ever thought you could use
"stunning" to describe an umbrella?</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Two different times now I have been to the beach
and people ask to take pictures with me. They take turns posing with me with their
peace signs up...I think this is hilarious. The first time I was laying on the
beach (almost asleep) and a woman laid down in the sand (in pants, shirt and
sneakers holding an umbrella) to take a picture with me. By time I was aware of
what was happening she said thank you in Mandarin and ran away. </p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->McDonalds delivers....yes, you read correctly. I
didn't believe my eyes when I saw this! McDonalds has mopeds that zig and zag
through traffic to make fast food even faster.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Things are quickly wrapping up
here. I can't believe how quick the time has gone by! My work here is almost
complete. When Gary, Ally and Carmen administered the tests, they each made
some hand-written notes on the scoring sheets in Cantonese/Mandarin. The three of them have been very
busy, so I first focused on scoring the parts I could without their help for
translations. I have also watched the participant videos to verify that the
recordings were correct. From watching the test so many times, I have picked up
on very random words/phrases in Mandarin. There is no importance of knowing how
to say "sock" in Mandarin...but now I know it! I can also count to three!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">This week, Chris, one of the
students with ASD who works in the lab, came into the office to help me with
translating the notes on the score sheets. Chris is very smart and has been very helpful during my time here.
My first week, Chris would come to my dorm to pick me up so I didn't get lost
when I took the bus to the office. I have been very lucky to have his help!
Chris only calls me by my first and last name, which I think is funny.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I have been fighting a cold all
week. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I hate being sick when I am
not in the comforts of my own home. Hopefully I recover quickly so I can
explore this weekend! I love the weekends when I find a place to see online,
and then go see and experience the place in person!</p>

Here is an update and description of everything I have done and still need to
do. Hopefully in 2 weeks it is complete!!!</p><p class="MsoNormal">Food</p>

Sum means "little meals" It is a Hong Kong meal that is served in the
afternoon/early evening. There are a variety of types and the little "dumpling"
is steamed in a bamboo box. I have tried dim sum, however not in the proper
traditional setting.</p>

Kong is home to and imports many fruits I have never had: lychee, mangosteen,
dragon fruit, papaya and more. Lychee is by far my favorite. It is a small
grape-like fruit. You have to peel it and it contains a huge seed. It is much
sweeter than a grape, but the texture is similar. Another fruit I love here is
mango. I have had mango-flavored things before, but I have never bought mango
to eat fresh. This is a new favorite!</p>

Valley is not only in the middle of PA, but it is also in Hong Kong! I got all
dressed up to attend the horse races. When we got in the taxi to take us, the
driver told us they were canceled. Now, it is closed for the summer because it
is too hot. I am quite disappointed I did not complete this, but maybe that
just means I need to come back one day!</p>

taught me some technique. By the end I was drenched and couldn't walk for about
two days. A great workout but even better cultural experience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This weekend I attended a professional development event led
by James Law, a professor at Newcastle University. This event was mostly for
professionals; however, I did meet one other student. On Saturday, Professor Law
taught us mostly about evidence-based practice and how to apply it to our
research. This event helped me realize that my education does not end once I
have a degree and that I will be a life-long learner. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Day two of the conference was very interesting. We were to
read an article and then put into groups. Each group had specific questions to
answer and share their findings. We had a great group discussion. It was very
interesting how Professor Law's questions dissected the article. I was able to
think about aspects of the topic that I wouldn't have thought to examine. I
usually read an article and think it must be right, but he taught us how to
make sure an experiment is reliable before we begin to perform a similar
experiment. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After the lunch break we were grouped based on areas of
interest. (I chose Autism) We were assigned to design a reliable experiment;
our group chose "Lego Therapy." This treatment is a type of play therapy that promotes
social interaction in children with Autism. I had never heard of this topic
before. In simple terms:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Children with Autism, ages 6-11, are placed into groups of
three:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Child 1- give directions to child 2</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Child 2- in charge of each piece and handing the pieces to
child 3</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Child 3- toy assembler follows directions from child 2</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When it was time to present, my group automatically handed
the mic to me. I think they assumed the only American in the room wouldn't be
afraid to speak up. I/We presented out hypothetical experiment and got very
positive, constructive criticism. I preferred the group aspect of day two;
however, most other people preferred day one, which was entirely lectured. I
loved hearing the other groups present and learning about other possible
experiments on various topics. This event was a great learning experience and I
am very happy Carol invited me to attend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We have completed all of the data collection with the
children at both preschools. I owe a huge thank you to Gary, Ally and Carmen
for helping me conduct all of the tasks. In total, we were able to run the
experiment with 18 children. As I begin to analyze the data, the children are
scoring pretty well. Thus far, the results suggest an advance in executive
function. I have some work to do before I can make that statement that with
certainty. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This week I have had some interesting food experiences. At
first, I shied away from very local food. I have learned the local places are pretty
cheap for lunch, but the menus rarely have English and the workers do not speak
great English. But I want to take advantage of my time here so I thought I
would give local food a shot. For lunch, I ordered beef noodles and lemon tea
for "take away" as they say here. I was waiting and waiting and waiting.
Finally I showed the man my receipt (that was in Cantonese) and he handed me
the fried rice that had been sitting on the counter for at least ten minutes. I
didn't want them to throw it away so I just ate it. I have no idea what kind of
meat it was...it looked like cut up hot dogs. It wasn't too bad, but I just laugh
when things like this happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Last
night I went to dinner for dim sum. I got to the restaurant at 7pm and dim sum
ended at 5 pm. The website said dim sum was served until 11 pm. I was
disappointed, but I still tried to be adventurous. We ordered half a goose and
it came to our table with the head at the top of the plate. I was hoping I
wouldn't see the head, but anticipating it. It was actually pretty tastey, but
full of bones so quite difficult to politely eat with chopsticks. I will give a
full report when I finally try dim sum!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This week I was part of a study for the department of Speech
and Hearing Sciences. After reading others' blogs about tracking down
participants, I was happy to help. The study examined English-native speakers
on tone and stress perception. I was in a soundproof room and listened to three
two-syllable sounds. I had three seconds to choose if the first or third sound
was the same as the second sound. I could clearly hear the difference in most,
but some were really tricky with only slight variations. It was an interesting
experiment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Today, I took the afternoon and went to Big Wave Bay Beach. The
name is a bit ironic because the waves were almost non-existent. I had read
that Big Wave is a surfer's paradise, but it was more like a lake with calm water. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It sure was beautiful! The water was very warm
and pretty clean.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">I love how safe Hong Kong is. I could leave my phone and
wallet in my bag unattended on the beach while I was in the water. I still use
caution and make sure I don't bring too much cash and leave my debit cards in
my room. The people are very honest here and crime is very low. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Speaking of safety, Hong Kong is probably the safest place I
have ever been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One day I was in a
very large and crowded Starbucks doing work. A woman came and put her purse
down to save a seat and got in line (which was about 25 feet away and out of
view from the table). She came back about 10 minutes later and her purse was
untouched and still there. In Philadelphia that would never happen! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am very excited for the end of the week as we return to
the preschools. Session two of the tasks takes about 4o minutes so we will be
at the preschools all day the next two days. I am interested to see how the
kids do and will have more updates over the weekend!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm sorry this blog is a week late. I thought I posted it over the
weekend, but my internet is quite testy here! I'm glad I saved it in a word document. Now you just get two blogs in a
row.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What a successful week! This week I went to two different
preschools to run the tasks with the kids. The teachers and principals at each
school were so kind to us and the kids could not have been any cuter or well
mannered. Some of the kids even practiced a little English with me shouting
"HELLO" when I walked through the hallway.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first preschool was around the corner from our office,
which was very convenient. The children scored pretty well on the tasks (from
what I can tell so far at least).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The second preschool was over an hour away. We got very lost on the way
there. Every time we asked for directions, people sent us different ways. We
finally made it. Thank goodness we left plenty of time to get there and were
able to run the test with all of the children. In total, we completed the first
session of tasks with 16 children. I am very happy with 16 children because for
a while we only had 8 consent forms!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Bilingualism at such a young age really amazes me. Most of
the children speak Mandarin and/or Cantonese at home, Cantonese at school,
begin learning English at 3-4 years old. Some even speak an additional dialect
of Chinese. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Gary and Ally go back
and forth speaking Cantonese conversationally, Mandarin for most of the tasks
and English with me. I have learned some Cantonese words and phrases, but
unfortunately I will not be bilingual!</p>

Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:black"><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">Like most of the other students,
things in Europe are wrapping up. I've had my last participant. I've moved out
of my flat, and I've said goodbye to my friends and coworkers. As a rule, I
hate goodbyes. These past few days, although relatively productive and fun have
been clouded by the "this is the last time I'll ever do this"
feeling. It's how I always get at the end of something. I have trouble enjoying
the present because I know what big changes are coming in the future.
Nevertheless, I've still tried to make the most of the past few days.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:black"><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">Although I may not have gotten the warm
beachy summer everyone dreams of (*cough cough, Granada people. Im still
jealous of you), I still immensely enjoyed this summer in Berlin. And I feel
like I may have gotten more out of the experience because of it. I spent more
time in the lab and at home rather than outside and therefore became close with
my coworkers and roommates. Plus, I've now learned to truly appreciate a
beautiful day!<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:black"><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">When people ask what I've gotten most
out of this experience, my answer, without a moment of hesitation, is always
that I've learned the true extent of my independence. Last time I was abroad, I
missed home the entire time, but this time, I was pretty much completely on my
own for two months, and I hardly thought of home even once. There was a period
of time when I lived a pretty solitary life just after arriving in Berlin, but
even then, I was completely content to be on my own. It wasn't scary to think
about the necessity to forge relationships and get my study underway. It was
actually exciting. So here I am at the end of it all, and I'm able to say that
I am very content with what I've done here and with the person that I've
realized I am. Thank you, PIRE, for this eye-opening and unforgettable
experience! Now to code all of this data...</font></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="MsoNormal">Has it really been 8 weeks? Honestly the time has just
flown. For the past two months I felt like I have been in an all out blitz to
test as many participants as possible.&nbsp;
Although our participants did not seem interested in returning for a
follow-up O-Span session, I'm still very impressed with the number of people we
tested during this short time. While we still have a lot more people to test,
it's really exciting to be able to say that we're done with one of the most
crucial phases of our experiment.<span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This last week though has been really beneficial for
beginning to look at our data and drawing preliminary conclusions.&nbsp; On Wednesday we presented the trends we
observed in the lab meeting and people were quite interested to hear our
results. Afterwards we met with Julia Morales, the graduate student whose
AX-CPT task we had been using. She helped us with some of the data analysis and
also had some helpful advice about what to look for in the results. It will be
great to have her as a contact we continue to collect more data.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally I would just like to say that it has truly been a
blast here in Granada, and that these past 2 months have been some of the best
of my life. When I arrived I still felt like I was learning how test people
most efficiently, and since coming here I have become a testing pro. Once I get
back to State College I'm looking forward to testing more people and doing a
deeper data analysis, but before that I am looking forward to some much needed relaxation.
I'd just like to close by saying that this is not an "Adios" Spain but merely
an "Hasta luego".<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You will all be glad to hear that the presentations went
without a problem. I was more frightened than I should have been. The lab was
not mean, or criticizing, but just interested in what were doing. All in all
they were pleased with the presentations and happy we were there. We were
invited to attend their poster presentations on Friday. They were really
impressive, not what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting the posters
to be all in Spanish, and made myself thing that it was better just to look and
try and understand the main concepts of each one. When we arrived I was pleased
to see that a lot were in English, I believe almost half.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So this last one will conclude the blog of my PIRE
experience. It was the most amazing things that have happened to me, and I am
so thankful to be granted this opportunity to not only explore the country, but
also to further my knowledge with research, and meet amazing people who make up
Teresa Bajos lab. I hope that one day I will be able to come back and either
work with them or just be able to visit this fantastic city. For the rest of
the time here I will be doing a lot of cleaning and souvenir shopping!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I want to give a special thanks to my advisor Karen Miller
and believing in me enough to let me come here!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adio!<o:p></o:p></p>

            <title>Saying Goodbye</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">It's unbelievable to think of how formative such a short
time can be.&nbsp; As someone who's got a lot
of things left to learn, it's remarkable to me still how significant the
changes are that one single year brings.&nbsp;
Friends are lost, friends are gained, perspectives are expanded,
opinions are changed, and you find a little more of yourself as time continues
to pass.&nbsp; I've just finished sophomore
year, and in many ways my life is at a crossroads.&nbsp; It's almost odd watching myself grow and
following these changes as I slowly begin to settle into what I want to be, and
I honestly hope that the changes are a trend that won't stop when I hit a
certain age. &nbsp;My time spent at PSU has
certainly been enriching in many ways, but a large part of the growing I've done
has been in a more academic sense as I've begun to acquaint myself with all
sorts of different fields and subfields in linguistics, translation,
literature, and language studies. &nbsp;But
Granada has been a marvelous blend of the academic and the personal growth that
I could never have reached at Penn State.&nbsp;
Granted, I love my school, but between the mountain of credits I take,
my extracurrics, and everything else I never really have a chance to sit back
and reflect on what I'm doing until a week after it's all over (and I've slept
for 14 hours a night in my bed at home).&nbsp;
My time here has been a blitz, but I dictated the hours in my days,
which gave me the ability to breathe when I needed to.&nbsp; I've taken in incredible sights, and I've had
the great fortune to meet even better people.&nbsp;
This grant, this city, this time abroad has done exactly what I had
hoped it would do, because contrary to what most people think I don't think
going abroad changes you.&nbsp; I don't
believe there's some intangible line that's crossed when you leave the country,
and all of a sudden you become a clay figure that's shaped by eating actual
Italian lasagna for the first time or going to tapas...no, what going abroad does
(<i>al menos a mi modo de ver</i>) is give
you the opportunity to look at everything you know from another angle: your
country, your friends, and most importantly, yourself.&nbsp; If you keep your ears, mind, and heart open,
you can learn more than you could ever imagine. That, combined with some
serious introspection, is what ultimately shapes you into the final,
post-abroad version of yourself that will step off the airplane into the arms
of family and friends when you get home.&nbsp;
My PIRE Grant is over, but so much is just beginning now - a week of
travel entirely on my own, a thesis that has yet to be written, disseminating
all of the work I've done, junior year, maybe even thinking about <b><i>grad
school</i></b> (seriously, what is THAT all about!?) <br />

            <title>Where has the time gone?</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>So I am in my final week here in Granada and I can't believe that my time here is shortly coming to an end. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been able to run a total of 34 participants during my time here in Granada and I am very happy about this number. While I know that I will probably have to throw out&nbsp;a couple of these people out after looking through there LHQs and because of a couple computer issues, I am overall feeling very successful. After all of the stress of finding participants and making sure to schedule them before their study abroad programs ended this is a great number. Now returning back to Penn State I will need to do some catching up to get a more even number of participants in my Pre-Abroad group which I currently have only ran 9 people.</p>
<p>Today during the lab meeting all of the PIRE students presented our projects. This&nbsp;was the first time (besides a poster presentation) that I have presented anything about my&nbsp;study&nbsp;to a group of people. I was very nervous&nbsp;before the meeting but&nbsp;afterwards I felt like I did a good job and&nbsp;it wasn't really as bad as I had been expecting. Unfortunately I wasn't able to present a lot of the data that I have been collecting here but hopefully at the next meeting that I speak at I will have all my data analyzed and be able to have an even better presentation. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Over this past weekend I finally went to the Alhambra and took a self-guided tour. I was amazed by how large and beautiful this castle is. The rose gardens were absolutely amazing and I couldn't stop taking pictures of every single flower I saw because it was all just too pretty. The view from the top part of the Alhambra was also very impressive. It allowed you to look over the entire city of Granada and see the Sierra Nevada, which still has snow on the top. </p>
<p>With only a couple days left here in Granada I am hoping to spend more time walking around the city and really enjoying what time I have left! </p>

            <title>The homestretch</title>
            <description><![CDATA[The past two weeks have been the craziest, most exhausting, and downright chaotic weeks of my entire PIRE experience...in a completely good way. I believe I last posted while I was in the process of running participants, transcribing BNTs, and assisting in the International Child Phonology Conference preparations. So to start with the conference...<div><br /></div><div>The conference went incredibly well! In regards to the planning, everyone involved did a phenomenal job in making things run smoothly. Sure, we had long days of setting things up, taking things down, and managing everything in between, but it was a fun time just getting to know each other and feeling like we were contributing something to the program here. ICPC was the first conference I've ever attended, so going into it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. (I was also a little nervous because all of the people attending and volunteering had a background in language acquisition, whereas I have only taken one course on the topic.) It only took one coffee break and one session of talks for me to realize that getting involved in the conference was probably the best decision I've made during my PIRE experience. I made friends with other students, met so many brilliant people, and learned a lot of new things about language acquisition. Everyone was so open and easy to talk to, and when I didn't understand something (especially during the poster session!), they were all more than happy to explain things in more simple terms for me.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then there was the pancake boat experience...</div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/pancake.jpg"><img alt="pancake.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2013/06/pancake-thumb-200x136-381386.jpg" width="200" height="136" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>For dinner after the second day of the conference, we had access to unlimited pancakes and a ball pit (yes, the crew allowed us to be kids for the evening!), and enjoyed an evening of mingling and cruising on the beautiful river.</div><div><br /></div><div>After the conference, I had one day of down time before it was off again for more adventures...SPAIN! To keep this short, Spain was a much-needed break from the cold, rainy Dutch weather. The country was beautiful, everyone there was just so happy, and it was refreshing to be able to understand a lot of the language. Not to mention, I got to spend a lot of time with my fellow PIRE cohorts, and got to know them better than I did at Penn State. We went to the beach for a day, hiked for a few hours in a small mountain town, and hung out in Granada. I also got to spend a few extra days there because of a minor issue with a bus to the airport, causing me to miss my original return flight. It was inconvenient, yes, but there are worse things than being stuck in Spain for a few days!</div><div><br /></div><div>Now I'm back in the lab for my last week, trying to get as much work done as possible. On Sunday, my mom and sister will fly in to meet me in Amsterdam, then we'll travel around for a little bit. This is my sister's first time out of the United States, and I am so excited to show her around!!</div>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal">It has been another exciting and busy week here. Last week,
I met Gary and Ally, the two students who will help administer the experiment
with the children. We heard back from the kindergartens and it
looks like we have ten children to run the test with. Next week, we will go to
the kindergarten to administer the test so I have a lot of work to do this week
in order to be prepared. I have been working with Gary and Ally so they know
how to properly run each task. It is very exciting as we begin to prepare.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, after a morning in the lab, I took the bus and went
to Victoria Peak. This is one of the highest points in Hong Kong with a huge
lookout over the city and harbor. The view is absolutely breathtaking. When you
are in the city, you look up at all of these buildings that seem so tall. It
was amazing to be at the Peak and so high above the buildings. I spent the
afternoon there and stayed until dark so I could see all of the buildings lit
up. This was definitely a sight I'll never forget.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I had my very first authentic meal here on Sunday! Some
friends and I went to Cheung Chau, which is one of Hong Kong's islands. It took
about 30 minutes to get there by ferry. We ordered lots of dishes and shared
everything: prawns, fish, chicken wish pineapple and rice. Each meal was prepared and cooked
differently, but everything was delicious!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The only utensils I had was a Chinese soup spoon and
chopsticks. Let's just say I need a lot of practice eating with chopsticks! One
of the ladies at lunch gutted the fish with just chopsticks and served each of us a
piece...I was very impressed. I really loved this island; the people were very
friendly and the way of life is much simpler than Hong Kong Island. Vehicles
are not permitted in Cheung Chau, so everyone walks or bikes around. It was
nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong Island for the day! </p>

            <title>Bajo la luna gitana...</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">I have to apologize for last week - as you've probably
surmised already, it was a bit of a hectic time, but I did successfully run my
last participant in the lab! Everything is now done, save for organizational
things and presenting my experiment to the graduate students and Dr. Bajo on
Wednesday morning! It's an exciting time now - I get to do lots of reading,
powerpointing, and can actually now schedule hangouts with my Spanish friends
or excursions through the little corners of Granada I haven't seen yet.&nbsp; It's a busy, but satisfying process; one of
the aspects of Granada I love the most is the friendliness of the people.&nbsp; Yes, it's a touristy oriented town, and yes,
it's an ERASMUS oriented town, but there is a true kindness among these people
that I haven't seen anywhere else.&nbsp; A
smile, a short conversation, and one return visit often makes a friend, and the
perspectives and histories I've heard account for some of the most significant
moments I've had here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not an hour ago
a man I've gotten to know at a Kebab place here gave me free food when he knew
I didn't have enough euros to pay for a full lunch, saying it wouldn't be a
problem to make up the difference when I find money again.&nbsp; He then proceeded to make me a magnificent
doener and we talked about his time in Spain, places he takes his kids around
Granada that he recommend I visit before I go, and my life in America (he didn't
know I was American until I told him today, I guess! Confidence boost!)&nbsp; On a slightly related note, that's enormously
surprised me - I can count the people that have identified me as American when
I'm by myself on one hand, and I've heard guesses from all around: Scotland,
Italy, Germany, Ireland, Argentina, France, Britain, and the list goes on.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My roommates were all in Morocco for the weekend, so after getting Kaylee
squared away with her bus/flights on Saturday evening I toured the Alhambra by
moonlight! It was something truly surreal, wandering around the fortress in the
cool (thankfully) night air and listening to the French National Orchestra, who
were playing in the Generalife Gardens at the time.&nbsp; I went a bit mad with my camera, and even though
the tour of the Palacios Nazaries lasted only about 45 minutes before I was
shooed out by the workers I had a lovely time ambling between the moonlit
chambers, following the flow of fountains constructed into the floors, and
taking in the Granada skyline at night.&nbsp;
Sacromonte was lit up like an American Christmas display, with the
colored lights of Camborio (along with the pumping bass of the music) being the
only exception to an otherwise enchanting display of lamps, porch lights, and illuminated
plazas that dot the barrio.&nbsp; The next day
when everyone got back we toured the entire Alhambra, but there was something
about the serenity of the place at nighttime that wasn't quite replicated when
the sun was out.&nbsp; Goal for next time? Hit
the Generalife Gardens at night.&nbsp; I'm not
the kind of person to <i>enamorarme</i> with
a single place or moment in time, but the more I think about the time I've spent
here the more sense it makes for me to think that I will be back.&nbsp; The most cost-efficient way for me to achieve
that is not yet entirely clear, but I know this; I've sampled Granada, learned
its backstreets, nightlife, and sights, but I'm not yet finished here.&nbsp; As a famous time-travelling murderous robot/Austrian
bodybuilder turned Senator once said, "<i>Ah'll
be bahck</i>".&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/DSCF0360.JPG"><img alt="DSCF0360.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2013/06/DSCF0360-thumb-200x112-381342.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>]]></description>

            <title>Blog 5</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Sorry I didn't get to post my blog for last week, but I have
been pretty busy finishing everything up. There was a lot of work to be done
and spent most of last week in the lab all day working on coding and segmenting
out the data that I can for now. We have a presentation coming up on Wednesday
so its been busy putting together information and everything. It is harder in
my case because I am not able to get my exact data that I need right away. Most
of the information has to be done when I get home and extract that data from
the labs at Penn State. Other from that part the presentation should go on
without any problems. I am getting a little nervous for the presentation. From some
of the lab meeting that I have been a part of, it has been brutal and they
really do a lot of constructive criticism. When I sit there and listen it
sounds more like they are just ripping each other apart and yelling. I have
recently learned though, when Spanish people talk to each other, to non natives
it sounds like they are yelling and are fighting, but in reality its just that
they are talking loudly. A man was telling me that it was something to do with
the temperature of the country. Here it is really warm so everyone talks in a
louder more riled tone, where as in England it is not as hot so people talk
more calmly and softer. If that is true or not I have no idea, but for the sake
of my presentation if they start talking loudly I am just going to blame it on
the heat and not take the constructive criticism so harshly. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dan Birt and I had a very exciting and long weekend. We
decided to take a trip to AFRICA. We spent Friday in Tarifa Spain at the beach.
I tell you it was the most beautiful beach I have been to. I think I liked it
so much because it reminded me of home. There was actual sand and waves! The
food was also very much like home food. The most amazing spinach, cheese,
bacon, and tomato wrap I have had in a long time and smoothies that were close
to the ones at home. The ones in Granada say smoothie, but are actually just
juice. It was a nice change being able to have a homey feeling being that we
are so close to going home anyway. We then took the ferry Saturday morning over
to Morocco. We had a personal tour guide, and not once did ever feel unsafe. He
was amazing, showed us all the things he could pack into one day and he did.
The day felt like I blinked and it was over. We road camels on the beach and
saw the old part of the city, had an authentic Moroccan lunch with their famous
mint tea. We took a 6:15 am train from Tarifa, Spain back to Granada. We then
all got together and went to take a tour of the Alhambra. I say better late
than never, considering we have been here for almost two months and we are just
seeing it. It was beautiful. My favorite part was the gardens.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After a busy weekend, it is now Monday morning and I am
sitting in lab finishing up some work for my presentation on Wednesday. Sadly
this is the start of my last week in Granada.</p> ]]></description>

            <title>Blog 4</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">I have successfully received all ten of my native Spanish
speakers. Its way different testing them than testing the L2 Spanish speakers. The
natives are a lot quicker at the tasks. Where it would take the English
students a half hour to 45 minutes to complete, it really only took the Spanish
speakers at most 20 minutes, and the fastest I had was someone completing the
whole thing in ten minutes. While at the time it was great because he was so efficient
at it, it was not that great when I had to go back and segment his file. What
normally takes me 15 minutes to do what I have to do, took me double the time because
he was talking so fast that to segment out one vowel was almost torture! It was
fine though I got through it and everything turned out good. I havnt been able
to get 30 English participants but I was able to get around 23 to 24. I was
flooded in the beginning, by the first three weeks I already ran 17 people.
When the end of May hit, the English students started becoming scarce because
of getting ready to leave or getting ready for finals. So then I moved to
collecting British people, which was good because they were abundant. So I ran
a couple and then I&nbsp; ran into the problem
that their L2 was French and not Spanish. I was luck to find about 7 more who I
could run. Over the past month there has been a great influx of English student
here on an intensive 6 week program for learning Spanish. Unfortunately that
was one other road block I hit. Even though it was great we found all these L1
English L2 Spanish, I was not able to use them. They have only been here for
about a month and by the time they leave they will have only been here for two
months. They are too early and not enough emersion for me to use there. Luckily
they were useful to the other two researchers. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Culturally this past week was fantastic. We were able to do
so many things. On Wednesday we went to an authentic Flamenco show. The people
who put it on were all part of the same family, Three siblings, a niece, and
two cousins. They were fabulous always cheering each other on and helping. The
show was fantastic high energy, and the singing was beautiful, even though I didn't
exactly know what they were singing about. I have to give a lot of credit to
the two girls and the one guy who danced Flamenco a good part of the show. I
was really able to see the dedication they had in their facial expressions, and
how it wasn't just a job for them, but it was their life and what the loved to
do. I believe the girl who danced the most was only 15 or 16 years old and was
the second youngest professional flamenco dancer. Later that week Kayle decided
to take a break from the sunless Netherlands and came to sunny warm Granada. On
Saturday Britney Kaitlyn and I had a wonderful day. Monolo, a student in the
lab who has been nothing but great to us, took us to a hiking area called
Monachil and we hiked for about two hours. We saw waterfalls climbed on the
side of rocks and under rocks. The water in the streams and waterfalls were
coming from the melting of the snow on the Sierra Nevada, and YES there is
still snow on the mountains in Granada even though its like 90 degress
everyday. After the hike we went paragliding over the Sierra Nevada. It was no
doubt the best day I have had In Granada. The feeling of being as high as a
bird and being able to have an arial view of all of Granada, words can't even
explain the beauty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway there is another exciting week coming ahead!</p> ]]></description>

            <title>A Mixture of Cultures and Langugages</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Whoever came up with the idea to visit classes in order to recruit was a genius! All of that stress (not really) of visiting classes paid off, and this week I've had many responses! I'm set with more than enough participants to finish off my time here! What a relief too. I was really getting worried. So with some truly proficient participants, the testing continues!<div><br /></div><div>My roommates continue to be wonderful. When I return to the US, I will be fantastic at making pasta! It's sort of become a joke in the house to ask "Do you want pasta?" instead of "Are you hungry?" But really, I never knew there were so many ways to cook pasta! I can't wait to try it out for myself! In addition to mealtimes, my roommates and I have ended up spending a lot of time together. There is a very interesting dynamic between us, and it's a very trilingual atmosphere. The German speaks German and English, and the Italians speak Italian and German, and I am able to understand a good deal of the Italian and and get some German out. So being with them is always an interesting experience. It's been a great way to learn about Italy and Germany and also their attitudes towards each other!</div><div><br /></div><div>This weekend, a German family (family of a friend) from Flensburg invited me to stay with them. I am extremely excited to be able to see a different area of Germany and also get a taste for what German family life is like. They have already been extremely kind to me and offered to show me around town, cook, and take me to a concert. I'm amazed by their kindness, and can't wait to see their town!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>]]></description>

<p>This past week and a half in Granada has been filled with many exciting and cultural experiences here in Granada. I recently went to my first flamenco show which was absolutely amazing.&nbsp;It took place in this&nbsp;really pretty area up on the hillside&nbsp;and inside of caves. The dancing and singing was so passionate and the people did a wonderful job and seemed to really love what they were doing. It was great to see this traditional show and really gave me a good feel for the culture. </p>
<p>Another really fun activity that I did recently was hike Monachil in the Sierra Nevada. I think I can easily say this is one of my favorite things that I have done Granada. The trail was beautiful and had lots of narrow pathways and bridges that we crossed. We followed alongside the river as we made our way towards the top of the mountain and had a picnic lunch. After lunch we went back and headed to the place on top of the Sierra Nevada where I went paragliding. Paragliding was an amazing experience and I loved every minute of&nbsp;it. The view from the air was unbelievable and I was able to see all over the cities nearby and the&nbsp;mountain range which still had snow in&nbsp;certain parts. </p>
<p>Research here is going the same&nbsp;as usual. Participants are still a&nbsp;little hard to find but I was successfully able to run six people last week and am hoping to run a couple more this week. We have to present next week our findings&nbsp;during the lab meeting so I have been working on creating a PowerPoint for that presentation and getting all of my data collected so that I can begin analysis. &nbsp;</p>]]></description>

finally arrived safely in Kong Kong. Luckily, my advisor here, Carol To, and
two students, Chris and Catherine, picked me up from the airport. We took a
taxi to my dorm, or "hostile" as they call it. We had to carry my luggage up 3 flights
of steps to receive my key and another 3 flights up to my room. I was very lucky to
have the extra company to help me with my luggage. My room is nice; just a bit smaller than a Penn State dorm. My roommate, Luna, seems very sweet; she is
from Korea and speaks pretty good English. She is here for an internship. There
are not many people living in my building. Right now Luna and I are the only
two people that live on our floor. Hopefully, some other students arrive this
week so I can meet more people!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">On Wednesday it was a public holiday
for dragon boat racing. I was lucky enough to watch the races with my brother's
friend, Sara, who lives here. Sara took me on a "junk" (which is their word for
a big boat) to watch the races. The dragon boats were not elaborately decorated
like I had expected. It was a really fun and unexpected first day in Hong Kong!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Yesterday, Chris picked me up in
the morning to show me how to take the bus to Carol's office. My dorm is quite
far from her office so I'm grateful Chris could help me. I met many people within
the Speech &amp; Hearing department. I share an office with a few other
students. Carol took two of her students and me to a Japanese restaurant for
lunch. It was yummy and very nice of Carol. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has been a very busy first few days here. My body is
starting to get used to the time difference, but it will take a few more days.
I'm not sure if my legs will ever get used to all of the hills here! I thought
Penn State hills were tiring until I was faced with the almost vertical hills here.
Next week, I will return to the office and meet Gary, the graduate student that
I will be working with. I am excited to meet him and get to work!</p>

            <title>Living Like A Queen</title>
            <description><![CDATA[5 more participants! That's all I need! And that's all I've needed for about a week now, and they just keep alluding me. Since it appears I have used everyone I'll be able to with the student pool system, I've had to get more creative about recruiting participants, meaning that I have to overcome one of my biggest fears: students. On one hand, the people in my lab have been very helpful, emailing their friends and talking to their classes, and I have heard back from a few people that I'm working on finding a date that works for both of us. However, I still need to take my own steps to find participants, which means visiting the French classes and talking to teachers. It's amazing how a large group of students from a foreign country can terrify me so much. Standing outside the doors to the classroom, waiting for the professor with the other students (so far the professor has been at least 15 minutes late every single time!), I try to look nonchalant acting like I fit in and secretly hoping the teacher won't show up. But they always do, and I have to compose myself silently before creeping in to explain why I'm there. Call me chicken, but so far visiting those classrooms is the most difficult thing I've had to do in all my time here in Berlin. I better start hearing some responses for all of that trouble! haha<br /><br /><div>Aside from the horrible tragedy that is recruiting, life is splendid. Just this weekend, I receive three new roommates who will be living with me until the end of my stay here. Finally some&nbsp;consistency! And luckily they are all wonderful. The girl from München is very friendly and is always asking to go to a café or something, and the two Italian boys make us breakfast and lunch every morning and evening! I am living the life! I've learned not to refuse their constant offers of food, drinks, or whatever. They are insistent on sharing and won't take "no" for an answer! Overall, it's very nice to be living with people my own age now! And even better, they are all fluent German speakers (and the Italians don't speak any English), so when we are all together, everything is in German. It's so fantastic to be able to practice!</div><div><br /></div><div>I love this city more and more. Now that I'm not running as many participants, my work is mostly coding. And since I now only have access to my lab for half of the week because of another study, I try to do a lot of coding in various parks outside. Earlier this week, I went to Tempelhof-Berlin, the American airport when the wall the was still standing. Today, it has been converted into a park. Well, maybe not converted. Nothing has changed since it was an airport. The only difference is that instead of planes taking off on the runways, people are grilling, biking, roller blading, walking their dogs, attending concerts, etc. With my computer and a blanket, I joined them. It was a very interesting place to see! Somewhat eerie to have the deserted airport and equipment looming over all of the fun. But overall an educational and cultural experience!<br /><br />I also learned that Fredrick the Great was the one to introduce potatoes to Germany. Therefore the Germans cover his grave with them!</div><div><br /></div>]]></description>

            <title>Closing Remarks (Yeah, ya heard me right)</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<br />

<p class="MsoNormal">The title of this post is
obviously not a temporal reference, as I still have another month exactly
before returning to the good ol' US of A.&nbsp;
No, this is in reference to my experiment, which is still going
swimmingly but now frustratingly close to completion.&nbsp; I'm more than anxious to tackle my data
(which as I understand it means wrestling with E-Prime studio and R, hoo boy)
and I am so very, dearly close to being able to do so.&nbsp; As I sit now, I'm 33/36 for eyetracks and
29/36 (factoring in attrition, I'm 32/39) for behavioral sessions, and I'm
itching to close things down so I can closet myself off and stare at graphs
until the Americans present our findings on June 26<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; On a still slightly lab-related note, I would
like to point out the following: <br />
<br />
Our lab here is <i>beautiful</i>. I can't
say I've been confined to the basements of Thomas back home as I always did
eyetracking in Burrowes, but the scenic view of Granada, sleekness of the rooms
and design, and the industrial-strength air conditioners that circulate
glorious, freezing cold air through the building make this an absurdly
agreeable work environment.&nbsp; Though I
have been the only one to enjoy these temperatures so far, basking in the
50-degree air like some kind of bizarre arctic plant, now that we've broken 90
degrees for the first time in Spain I appreciate them all the more.&nbsp; I do not do well with heat, I mean at all (I'm
very much a 55 and rainy kinda guy), and even if my experiment's going to be
wrapping up soon I feel like, for the first time ever, I may have to schedule
my daily activities around a sun schedule as to not get dehydrated or burned.
(Incidentally, the humidity here is extraordinarily low and dehydration slips
in quick - I've learned this the hard way from my first few runs).&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Switching over to cultural experiences,
I officially experienced my first complete loss of language identification.&nbsp; Walking back from American Football practice
on Monday (the local league here are national champs and invited me to play!), I came across two lovely ladies that
looked about my age and were being a little less than inconspicuous with their
map.&nbsp; Now, this is where I have to divert
my tale in two so that my readers get the effect of the strangeness of this
brief encounter. <br />
<br />
What Happened:<br />
I asked them if they spoke English, they responded yes and then asked where a
local plaza was.&nbsp; Since plazas in Granada
are like intersections in a US city, I took a look at their map and pointed out
they had passed their destination and were heading towards the wrong one.&nbsp; They actually had to head in the same
direction I was going so I invited them to walk with me briefly, and we started
strolling.&nbsp; One of the girls complimented
me on my Spanish, and while I graciously accepted the compliment I was confused
- when had she heard me talk in Spanish? I identified them as English speaking
right off the bat, and don't talk in Spanish to those who address me in English
to avoid being rude.&nbsp; She stuttered
something, and then after 30 seconds of mutual conversational dysfunction we
arrived at their turn and I sent them on their way.&nbsp; Walking away, I was still quite perplexed
until I realized...<br />
<br />
What I Said: <br />
I asked them if they spoke English...<i>in Spa<font style="font-size: 1em;">nish</font></i><font style="font-size: 1em;">.
"¿Habl<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">ái</font></span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;ingle? (being true to form to Andalusian "s" lenition), to which they
responded "yes".</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp; </span></font><span style="font-size: 1em;"><font style="font-size: 1em;">When w</font>e were discussing
the plaza names, I saw the Spanish titles on the map and, without thinking,
went right into Spanish, saying something to the tune of "This one </span><i style="font-size: 1em;">se llama Platha Isabela la Católica</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">, you're
looking for </span><i style="font-size: 1em;">Platha Carmen!</i><span style="font-size: 1em;">" ...and in
that moment I understood two things: 1) the girl's extensive confusion, poor
thing, she must have thought I was either messing with her or not entirely all
together, and 2) I had no idea what was coming out of my mouth.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">Not the slightest clue.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">I've noticed a ton of perceptual changes in
my Spanish processing - reading is entirely different now, and going back and
forth repeatedly, while still demanding, is not nearly the crippling load it was before coming here.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">But it seems I've
actually gained the ability to lose the ability to control my speech.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">Granted, I was extraordinarily tired, but all
the same this was a tiny revelation in its own right.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">Methinks I need to do some serious reading on
executive control when I get home and get back up to scratch.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p> ]]></description>
