After our first lab meeting with John Lipski in August 2013, the notion of fieldwork was just beginning to materialize as a possibility. John introduced us to the inner workings of Lengua and to Palenque, but actually flying to Colombia to pursue linguistics seemed a bit farfetched. </span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Fast forward to May 2014: Mary Beth, Mindy and I flew to Cartagena. We immersed ourselves in the languages and the cultures. In Palenque, we learned about much more than a creole. We encountered an entirely different, yet not so foreign way of life and made some incredible friends along the way. Then, in June, we arrived in the Netherlands. With the help of Dr. Pieter Muysken and numerous other grad students and professors at Radboud University, we took our raw data and processed it into meaningful, sharable results. Besides making progress with our research, we had the chance to really live life day-to-day in a new city. Also, I had the chance to befriend and to play ultimate with Radboud's team, the BFrisbee2's, a great bunch of people. Even when I'm in beautiful Spain and back in State College continuing work on my research, I will sorely miss Nijmegen.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">And so, the time has come to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who made this summer possible. This wasn't just a overseas research crunch-the-numbers kind of experience; this was unforgettable. Thank you to everyone at Penn State who works hard to make PIRE happen. Thank you to Dr. Muysken for being such a patient teacher and for being so excited on our behalves. Thank you to John for everything, particularly helping us to love Palenque as much as he does. Thank you to all the kind, generous, (mostly Dutch) people I've met here, especially the BFrisbee2's. Thank you to Jenny who worked on a separate PIRE project in Nijmegen. I wish she could have stayed longer! And finally, thank you to Mindy and Mary Beth. Without you guys, this summer would've had a lot less laughter and far fewer adventures -- it wouldn't have been the same!</span></p><br /><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/DSCF0885.JPG"><img alt="in den haag.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/DSCF0885-thumb-200x150-402001.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><br /></p><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17.25px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 17.25px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Gracias, bedankt, and thanks!</span></div></span> ]]>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two months flew by incredibly fast. These last few days in Nijmegen have been bittersweet. I have conflicting emotions of wanting to go home, see my family and friends, and start the next semester but also not wanting to leave this beautiful country. I don't want the adventures to end either, but thankfully we've got one more left.&nbsp; On Monday we are headed to Spain. We will be traveling to Barcelona, Granada, Malaga, and Seville. It seems like a lot and it was stressful at times to plan but it will definitely be worth it. I am looking forward to exercising my Spanish muscles again. They have been out of use since Colombia, two months ago, and have been struggling to keep quiet. I just hope I can start where I left off with my Spanish speaking. It improved exponentially in Colombia where I was immersed in the language. However, after two months of no practice I am afraid it may have dwindled a little bit. I am very excited to travel to yet another country and experience a culture very different from here in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know my situation was very different from the other PIRE students since it started out with field research, but also because I was fortunate enough to travel with Danny and Mary Beth. We have gotten very close during our travels and I am so happy I was able to experience all of this with them, and I can't forget Jenny! Its crazy how quickly you get close to people while you are traveling. I hardly knew Jenny before this trip and yet we became such great friends. I would have been much more challenging if I were on my own so I am very glad to have been surrounded by wonderful people. It has been great traveling together but also helping each other with our research and sharing ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am so grateful to have been given this opportunity and I would like to thank everyone from PIRE that arranged this experience. I would like to thank Dr. Pieter Muysken for his kindness during our stay and for his brilliance that was shared to improve our experiments. The entire Radboud CLS department was very welcoming and willing to help with our projects (and even invite us to lunch). Thank you to Prof. John Lipski for sharing all things Palenquero with us and for bringing us to Palenque, Colombia. Also, thanks to Prof. Lipski for taking time from your busy schedule to continue consultation with us during our stay here in Nijmegen. I have learned so much about linguistics and what goes into research projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2837.JPG"><img alt="IMG_2837.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/IMG_2837-thumb-200x150-401999.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></p><p class="p1"><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2837.JPG" style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"></a></span></p><p class="p1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1" style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em; border: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial, helvetica, hirakakupro-w3, osaka, 'ms pgothic', sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><span class="s1">I hope all my fellow PIRE students&nbsp;had great summers</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;and are getting some interesting results.

He not only taught us about Lengua throughout the past year, shared articles with us, discussed his experiences and answered our many questions, but he also offered us the opportunity to conduct our research projects in Palenque, Colombia. I will never be able to sufficiently express my gratitude for our time in Palenque. It was one of the best experiences of my life. In addition to guiding us through our first research projects, John also introduced us to many incredible Palenqueros whose warmth and kindness I will never forget. He furthermore helped me to realize how much I love the field of sociolinguistics, and I can't wait to keep working with him in the fall!</span></p><br /><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">I would also like to thank my fellow PIREates, Mindy, Danny and Jenny. I could not have asked for better friends to spend the summer with. Together we coded, cooked, learned some Dutch vocabulary, explored via fiets, adventured through Europe and had so much fun. Thank you to each of you for being so smart, fun and wonderful, and I look forward to many more family dinners together this fall. :) </span></span> ]]>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spreadsheets have become my life. Everywhere I go I see them. My brain thinks in rectangles. The hardest part about coding is trying to see through the endless possibilities and just focus on one. I look at speech samples from 35 participants and not much is consistent. Which makes perfect sense. We do not all speak exactly the same way. One of the consequences that coincide with field work is that your experiment doesn't turn out exactly the way you plan. So although I was looking at code-switching and have gathered significant data on the topic, I can't help but see how much participants vary in grammatical and lexical features. It was so interesting to see the variation while I was transcribing all of my recordings last month. However, now the variation has become my enemy. Somehow this variation needs to be made into codes so that I can get statistical results of Lengua Palenquera and how it is spoken. It is a slow and thought provoking process. I now truly understand the tediousness of analyzing linguistic data and I hold in high regard researchers who have been doing this for many years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last week Danny, Mary Beth, and I met with a doctoral student who studies Javanese influence on Dutch spoken in Suriname. When I heard this I was blown away. I had no idea there is a Dutch presence in Suriname, and of course I've never heard of Javanese before. I never entirely thought about how many different linguistic situations can be studied. English is my native language so I'm always thinking about bilingualism among English and other languages but I am naive to think in this way when there are so many other language combinations out there. I somewhat acknowledged their existence but never fully thought about just how many possible combinations there are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As far as traveling goes, we have toned down our international adventures a little bit. This week Nijmegen is hosting their annual Four Days Marches. Four Days of over 100,000 incredible people walking 40-50 km. There is an array of people that March; young, old, and the prevalent military group. For those that do not walk, there is plenty of entertainment in the center city. There are large performance stages on most streets, food carts selling international and common carnival foods, a Ferris wheel and other small rides, plus many more activities. Even in four days I don't think it would be possible to see everything going on in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I can't believe how fast my time here has gone. I feel that I have achieved a lot but I'm not quite ready to leave yet. I love being in Europe and learning so much about different cultures, cities, and people. I have done this both through traveling and through meeting people in the CLS here at Radboud.&nbsp;</span></p> ]]>

No doubt, however, that Nijmegen is still really, really old -- at least 1,000 years.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="padding: 6px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-family: Times; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9GN_YJtntJ0/U8a2mjoTf9I/AAAAAAAAA4c/qwagCcU7GMU/s1600/2014-06-09+11.44.19.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-orig-src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9GN_YJtntJ0/U8a2mjoTf9I/AAAAAAAAA4c/qwagCcU7GMU/s1600/2014-06-09+11.44.19.jpg" height="126" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9GN_YJtntJ0%2FU8a2mjoTf9I%2FAAAAAAAAA4c%2FqwagCcU7GMU%2Fs1600%2F2014-06-09%2B11.44.19.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="400" style="cursor: move;" /></a></p></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px; padding-top: 4px;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><font face="Times, Times New Roman, serif">Panorama of Nijmegen</font></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">_____________________________</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Contents</b></font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History</font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.

When Allied bombers attempted to push the Germans back into Germany, they mistook Nijmegen for a German city and laid siege to it. Countless buildings were destroyed; numerous historic homes, churches, etc. were razed. As a result,&nbsp;architecture&nbsp;in Nijmegen today features a healthy mix of classic and contemporary style.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font><u style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: xx-large;">Topography &amp; Climate &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Dutch standards, Nijmegen is very hilly.

The majority of Nijmegen's residents live within a few kilometers (or&nbsp;<i>a couple&nbsp;</i>miles) of the City Center. The city is quite sprawling, however, and there are very few high-rises.

A high volume of bikes also results in a high volume of of bike-thefts. Nijmegenaars who wish to keep their bikes lock them in bike racks, some of which are two-stories high. A special police bike-traffic control unit periodically hauls off unlocked bikes.

Students test into one of seven "tracks" at a fairly young age, around the beginning of high school. Although there is room for movement from one track to another, only the most academically inclined students -- those in the top track -- can go on to a university. Others will graduate en route to a college. Still others will be go on to vocational training.

Nearly all Nijmegenaars are bilingual or better, with English being the most popular second language. Many departments at Radboud University function in English. For foreigners attempting to order food or buy a bus ticket, there are no shortages of Dutch to English translators available. For foreigners attempting to learn Dutch, there is little hope. Besides some common&nbsp;ancestry and certain cognates, Dutch and English are not mutually intelligible. Dutch people are the first to declare that Dutch is difficult to pick up. Dutch people are also the first to switch into English when a foreigner is struggling, e.g. trying to order a "pizzadag," which is not a food, but a promotion meaning "pizza day."&nbsp;</font></p></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></b></p></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attitude</b></p></div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stereotypically, Dutch people, including residents of Nijmegen, are friendly, helpful, and humble. The Netherlands has a comparatively small wealth gap and this is evidenced by only slight differences in Nijmegen home sizes. Dutch culture promotes the idea of social equality and scoffs at the notion of showboating or putting on airs. A famous Dutch saying ("Doe maar normaal, dan doe je al gek genoeg.") translates literally to "Just act normal, then you're acting crazy enough as it is!" which translates to "Even though you're weird, it's better to just roll with it."&nbsp;<br /><br />Throughout history, outsiders have also voiced their opinion on Dutch culture. In the early 1600s, the Japanese interpreted Dutch forthrightness and lack of social hierarchy as a lack of social grace, suggesting that "Where a Dutch person has walked, not even grass will grow." However, there are acres (and hectares) of grass growing in Nijmegen.</font></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br /></font><u style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: xx-large;">Portrayal in the Media &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</u></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="line-height: 22.200000762939453px;">Mainstream American media has not heard of Nijmegen.

        <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Here it is- the post I've been dreading writing- the last
post. I've finally completed my research here in Granada, and I don't want to
leave! My flight leaves tomorrow morning, so I'm all packed and ready to go.
This experience was so great, and it came to an end much quicker than I hoped.
In the end I wound up testing 33 participants. I'm very happy with this number.
Although I'm sad to be leaving Spain, I am eager to get home and back to Penn
State in August to start coding my data. I am very excited to see how it all
turns out. I haven't had the opportunity to code any of it yet, so it will be a
complete surprise. Before my last day, which was today, I had the opportunity
to take some pictures around the lab. Here are a few.<o:p></o:p></p>

<a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_7588.JPG"><img alt="IMG_7588.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/IMG_7588-thumb-200x150-401945.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

Both cities were beautiful. Being in central Spain and then northern Spain was
much different than living here in Granada. Both cities are very big and full
of life. Granada is full of life as well, but it's a different, more laid back
life that I grew accustomed to. I met many new people in Madrid, and in
Barcelona I met up with a friend that I met on my trip to Morocco. Although I
only had about 36 hours in both cities, I had the time to explore and see all
the famous sites- the Prado museum, Plaza Mayor, the Sagrada Familia, Park Güell,
and some other things as well. I was happy to be back in Granada yesterday and
today though to say my goodbyes. I spent a lot of time walking around the city
to take it all in before heading home. I stopped by the cathedral and the
Cartuja monastery which I hadn't had the time to see before. They were both
beautiful. I also did some last minute souvenir shopping for my friends and
family back home. It was a great last few days.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1em;">I want to take the time now to give a few shout outs. First
I'd like to say that everyone at CIMCYC was so much help to me while I was here
in Spain. I had many, many questions along the way, and everyone was so willing
to help me, no matter how small the problem. I am very thankful to everyone in
the lab, including my mentor, Teresa, who I am very grateful to for allowing me
to come into CIMCYC and feel like I was part of the team.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next, a big thanks to Paige for making Spain so much fun! We
had so many great experiences together, and I would have been very lost around
Granada and Spain without you here. Have fun traveling around Spain and France
these next two weeks. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next up, Christian! Thank you so much for all of your help
getting my stimuli ready for Spain. Without you I wouldn't have had anything to
bring to Spain, and I am so happy that you were able to help me out. I'm grateful
for your help this summer back at Penn State as well. I'm sure we will be
working together a lot in the fall, and I'm really looking forward to it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And last, but certainly not least, Eleonora. Thank you for
everything these past several months. You helped me so much from the very
beginning of my application right up through my time here in Spain. I'm so
happy we've had the chance to work together, and I can't wait to get back in
the lab this fall!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I hope everyone enjoys the rest of their summer, and I'll be
seeing you all in August. I hope all the other PIRE students had as great a
time as I did, and I'm excited to see all of your end results. Cheers to a
great PIRE Summer 2014.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I do
not understand how research was done before the age of the internet. Every day,
I sent out emails to grad students, doctoral students, friends of friends, and
anyone else who I discover is a native English speaker. I sent out so many
emails that I kept a template message in a Word document and just changed the
name each time I emailed someone new. While a lot of the people who responded
were too busy to participate, I was absolutely blown away by the number of
researchers who took the time to help me find other potential recruitment
pools. I have to give a special shout out to Antje Stohr who sent me a long,
detailed email that included the names of English speakers she knew as well as
the heads of departments who may be able to send my recruitment call out in a list
serve. Nearly every time someone people emailed me that they could not
participate, they included at least one other potential recruitment source in
their response. I don't know if it's the researchers at Radboud or linguists in
general, but the individuals I talked to were so willing to help me. Only two
of my participants ended up coming from the SONA system; I found everyone else
through word of mouth. I am so grateful to everyone at Radboud University who
took the time to keep a young, naïve, undergraduate researcher from getting in
over her head. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
tedious as I found splicing sentences, I realized that I love running
participants. It's so gratifying seeing everything I worked for fall neatly
into place. Every day I ran a participant, I arrived at the Spinoza building an
hour early. I bought a delicious specialty coffee that probably had my daily
caloric intake in the whipped cream alone. I went to the cubicle I had booked
for the day, set up all my research equipment, and placed all the forms I
needed the participant to sign in a neat pile next to the laptop. When the
participant arrived, I walked them through the instructions of the experiment,
sat in during the trial sentences, then moved to a desk right outside the
cubicle for the duration of the study. During the hour and a half when my
participant was engaged in the experiment, I either read or chatted with one of
the other researchers also running their study. &nbsp;I loved the routine, the organization, and the
fact that the experiment I worked so hard on was slowly coming to life with
each new participant. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides
recruiting and running participants, my week also consists of a lab meeting
held every Wednesday. I've been to a lot of lab meetings throughout my time
working in Dr. Van Hell's lab, but I have definitely gained a new appreciation
for the presentations researchers give. Ever since I began working on my own
study, I realize just how much hard work goes unsaid in each presentation. The hours
spent creating stimuli, recruiting participants, and analyzing results gets
summed up in a manner of minutes. Each week, I listened to two researchers
discuss their experiments. I left every lab meeting with a deeper appreciation
for potential directions of linguistic research. I can't wait until I become
enough of an expert in the field to provide an insightful, highbrow comment of
my own at the end of a presentation. Right now, I'm more focused on paying
close attention so I can fully understand each researcher's experiment. I
realized I enjoy listening to presentations much more than I enjoy giving them.
At the last lab meeting of the year, I gave the final presentation about my own
research. I created the slide show a week in advance and knew all the talking
points I wanted to discuss. I was so nervous that I wasn't going to sound as
eloquent or educated as the doctoral students and post docs who presented in
the weeks before me. I'm sure I sounded incredibly nervous as I went through my
presentation, and I know I definitely spoke too quickly, especially considering
that English was not the native tongue of many of my audience members.
Nevertheless, I got through the presentation intact. I like to think I answered
all the questions with much aplomb. I'm proud to say that there were no
questions that stumped me completely. After I finished my presentation, I went
out for drinks with other members of Dr. James McQueen's lab. For the first
time, I felt like I was spending time with colleagues rather than superiors. I truly
felt like a researcher.<o:p></o:p></p> ]]>

On our last rainy day in the city, we strolled through Vondelpark, picking tulips and petting puppies. We also ate poffertjes, a delicious Dutch buttery dessert served with powdered sugar and toppings of your choice (in my case, nutella and banana).

        <![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Four weeks into PIRE have brought with them plenty of opportunity to develop our research from Palenque. Just last week, Mary Beth, Mindy and I were honored with the chance to present our findings to the LinC research group. Our presentation was preceded by two other presenters focused on attitudes towards East Asian heritage languages in the Netherlands. Afterwards, the three of us outlined our experiences conducting field research in rural Colombia, our specific projects, and our progress with analysis so far in Nijmegen. The questions and feedback from the room were exceptionally helpful. One visiting scholar, Dr. Kofi Yakpo from the University of Hong Kong, shed some particularly interesting light on perceptions of creole languages. Also, we had our first chance to meet our advisor at Radboud, Dr. Pieter Muysken. Dr. Muysken holds a laundry list of international achievements, but was excited to sit down with three undergraduate researchers. In the coming days, we'll have further opportunities to speak with and learn from Dr. Muysken as we continue analysis and start early drafts of our write-ups.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Four weeks into PIRE have also brought with them the temptation to draw comparisons. Colombia and the Netherlands might both be ideal locations for linguistic intrigue, but the two countries are vastly different. Perhaps no place are these differences more pronounced than when using public transportation. Leaving Cartagena by bus might as well be a ride to another planet next to a comparable journey leaving Nijmegen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p><div style="text-align: center;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yw_o8HJLyGg/U7rDT-AsdQI/AAAAAAAAA2g/VvGZAuvTkgs/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-07-07+at+5.56.34+PM.png"><img border="0" height="408" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-Yw_o8HJLyGg%2FU7rDT-AsdQI%2FAAAAAAAAA2g%2FVvGZAuvTkgs%2Fs1600%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2014-07-07%2Bat%2B5.56.34%2BPM.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" style="cursor: move;" /></a></p></div><div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p></div><div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;">Guess which one is which.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; text-align: center;"><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://www.alitravelstheworld.com/colombia/483x396xcolombia_buses_14_483x396.jpg.pagespeed.ic.DoV2_2bFc0.jpg"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alitravelstheworld.com%2Fcolombia%2F483x396xcolombia_buses_14_483x396.jpg.pagespeed.ic.DoV2_2bFc0.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="cursor: move;" /></a><a href="http://www.metro-magazine.com/images/news/M-BYD-ebus-Netherlands.jpg"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metro-magazine.com%2Fimages%2Fnews%2FM-BYD-ebus-Netherlands.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="cursor: move;" /></a></p></div><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"><br /></p></div> ]]>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's been
quite a busy and successful past week and a half since my last post.&nbsp; My parents came to visit me here in Mannheim
and we ventured over to Rothenburg for a nice weekend trip.&nbsp; The medieval town was absolutely gorgeous and
a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Mannheim.&nbsp; &nbsp;My
parents forced me to go bike riding (I have a slight fear of bicycles after
living in Penn State with all the crazy biker riders and some personal bad
experiences with bikes) to Kreuth, a very small town where my ancestors are
from.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very interesting to see,
especially because of how different this small town was from Mannheim or other
German cities. &nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

fortunate to have three more participants.&nbsp;
This brings me up to 29 participants total, which I am very happy
with.&nbsp; I am very excited to analyze all
of the data and see all the results.&nbsp;
Just from recording my participants, I can already tell that my results
are going to be quite interesting, especially from a speech-language
pathologist perspective. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">It's hard to believe that these two
months are already almost over.&nbsp; I
started my goodbyes yesterday and turned in my key to the office that Abby and
I shared.&nbsp; I have three more full days
here and then on Tuesday I am back in the U.S.&nbsp;
Overall, this trip has been an incredible experience and has taught me
many things.&nbsp; First and foremost, it
taught me about conducting my own research and how to recruit
participants.&nbsp; I learned exactly how
powerful word of mouth can be.&nbsp; It was
also a test of my independence.&nbsp; It's
easy to be away at college and just call up mom when you have a problem.&nbsp; That's not so easy here.&nbsp; I had to learn how to manage everything by
myself.&nbsp; I also had to step outside my
comfort zone and make friends and speak the language.&nbsp; This trip also reminded me just how fortunate
I am.&nbsp; I am so blessed to have had this
opportunity to come here in the first place.&nbsp;
Many of my friends might never get to study abroad, so I am so grateful
for this opportunity to learn and grow.&nbsp;
This trip also showed me how great my parents and friends are.&nbsp; They were all so supportive during my entire
trip, and it would have been much harder to accomplish all that I did without
them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><img src="webkit-fake-url://F28F9C86-BC21-479A-B666-514473CF93EF/application.pdf" /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I want to thank Abby for all of her
help during this trip.&nbsp; It was so nice to
have a friend here to explore and work with.&nbsp;
I want to thank Mike Putnam for advising me and helping me out on this
wild ride of research. &nbsp;A huge thank you
to all of the PIRE staff.&nbsp; I will forever
be grateful for this incredible learning experience.&nbsp; Thank you!<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">P.S. &nbsp;Happy 4th of July!</p>

        <![CDATA[I've been slacking a bit on my blog! Haven't written in a while, so I have much to catch up on.<div><br /></div><div>In my last entry I signed off talking about my upcoming weekend Morocco trip. Kyra and I took a bus from Granada to Sevilla, then transferred to a different bus from Sevilla to Tarifa, then transferred to a ferry that took us across the Mediterranean to Tangiers, Morocco! It was quite the journey, about 9 hours in all, but it was well worth it. Morocco is an entirely different world compared to Spain despite the proximity. We managed to ride camels by the beach, shop in the markets near the Medina, go on tours through the cities of Chefchaouen &amp; Assilah, and try traditional Moroccan cuisine such as couscous, slow roasted chicken and curry, batbout, and loose-leaf tea.&nbsp;<div><div><br /></div><div>The following week was pretty slow in the lab. It was the week of Corpus Christi and the annual fair, the biggest holiday in Granada at least. CIMCYC was closed Wednesday-Friday, and hey, I wasn't complaining about having a break from the lab. Kyra and I got the chance to explore the festivities of the holiday, which basically last for a week. On Wednesday we were able to see a parade through town of giant mannequins of kings and queens and a woman sitting atop a dragon. There were also people walking the streets with giant paper mache heads. &nbsp;I asked at least five different Granadinos what the significance was-- no one knew!&nbsp;</div><div>Here's a picture of the woman and dragon- the main event:</div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/10488079_10152211455920679_4818520651461273248_n.jpg"><img alt="10488079_10152211455920679_4818520651461273248_n.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/10488079_10152211455920679_4818520651461273248_n-thumb-200x150-401942.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a><div>That Thursday we went to the fair on the outskirts of town. There was an amusement park, open tents for dancing sevillanas (the traditional dance of Andalucia), and people riding around on horses in all different directions. The women wore traditional clothing, there were dance performances, concerts, and lots of beer and cured ham. Very Spanish I'd say.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I ended up posting more fliers (for the 4th time), because after the fair ended, finals were also coming to a close. I was hoping more students would be interested in my study considering they'd finally have more time on their hands. Despite the fliers, it was a pretty slow week last week as well. Thankfully, at the fair Kyra and I had met a Granadino who was bilingual in Spanish and English! I had decided to ask him if he wanted to participate in my study, and he did along with two of his bilingual friends! Sometimes the best way to recruit is just by talking with people.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Back to travels for little.. Kyra and I spent a beautiful five-day weekend in Sevilla, then Lagos, Portugal. We took a bus to Sevilla to explore the city for a few days and meet up with friends for tapas (BEST tapas of Spain by far). We then took a second bus to Lagos to enjoy a relaxing weekend at one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. We went kayaking and snorkeling and had the chance to see the sunset at the farthest point of southwest Portugal. It was thought to be the end of the world before the discovery that the world was round. It was a very cool sight to see. Here's a picture of me at Lagos:</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/10486077_10152211485575679_992259778298672462_n.jpg"><img alt="10486077_10152211485575679_992259778298672462_n.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/10486077_10152211485575679_992259778298672462_n-thumb-200x150-401940.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div>Onto the topic of the title of this post, it's my last week of research! I'm sad to say the least. This experience has gone by so fast, as life always does, and I'm completely blown that tomorrow will be my last day at the lab. I'll miss you CIMCYC! I have two more participants coming in tomorrow, which will make twenty-seven in total. I have surpassed my goal of twenty-five. All I need to do now is finish up coding the rest of my data, and I will be set to start working in the BiLD lab again in the fall to analyze everything.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Happy July everyone and I hope your summers are as fantastic as mine!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Next blog post to come: pictures of my research in action!</div></div></div>]]>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">Hello
again! I can´t believe it´s already July! I´m trying not to think about the
fact that this week is my last week of testing participants, but sadly it´s the
truth. I´ve now tested 30 participants. I have several more scheduled to come
in this week, and I´m hoping they all show up. Unfortunately my one participant
yesterday did not. I sent out reminder emails to the rest of my participants
for this week though, so I think that they will all come in. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">In
the past week, Paige and I went to Sevilla and Lagos. We met a ton of new
people at our hostel who were very friendly. We went out with several of them,
and we even met up with some of our friends that we met in Morocco. While in
Sevilla, I saw the Alcazar and the Cathedral. I also had some of the most
delicious tapas that I've had so far here in Spain. We were only in Sevilla
from Wednesday night until Friday afternoon, but we still managed to explore
the city and go on a walking tour. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">After
our brief time in Sevilla, we headed to Lagos. Lagos is an absolutely beautiful
beach town. The sandy beaches were a sight to see when we arrived. We got to
walk along the beach for a little before we went out to dinner with the group.
When we finally went to dinner, Paige and I met some new friends from around
the US. We went to a restaurant called NahNahBah which had the best burger I've
ever had. It had the usually toppings of cheese, lettuce, and tomato, but it also
had bacon and pineapple. The combination of toppings was perfect. It turns out
the owner of the restaurant is from Massachusetts. We weren't the only ones who
loved the burgers either. This restaurant was voted one of the top 50 burger
joints in the world. The group got to go out together after dinner as well. We
went to a few different bars around town, and then we went to a club to go
dancing. It was all very fun. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">On
Saturday, I went on a sailboat cruise with part of the group who was in Lagos. We
got to take small speedboats into the caves to explore. They were all very
beautiful. After the cave exploration, we went onto the bigger sailboat and got
to jump into the ocean. It was freezing, but very refreshing and fun. We jumped
in the water several times before we headed to the beach to take in the sun. I
went in the ocean for a little bit, and we all had a great time relaxing in the
sand. After leaving the beach and cleaning up, the group headed to the "end of
the world" to see the most southwestern point in Portugal that people once
thought was the end of the world. It was beautiful, and we got to watch the
sunset despite some clouds. The group then went out to dinner again and then to
another bar in town.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">On
Sunday, Paige and I went kayaking. That was so exciting. I had never been
before, and I was very eager to try it. We paddled through the caves again and
then stopped on a beach to go snorkeling. I've done that before, but it´s been
many years. I forgot how difficult it was to remember only to breathe out of
your mouth. We got to see some fish and some sea anemone. Our one friend has a
GoPro camera so he took a bunch of underwater pictures. I'm eager to see how
they turned out. After our excursion we headed out to lunch, at NahNahBah
again, and then back to the hotel to head home. We took the bus to Sevilla and
then caught another bus back here to Granada.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black;mso-themecolor:text1" lang="EN-US">I
don't officially know what my plans are for this weekend and next week, but I'm
hoping to go to Madrid and Barcelona in the last few days. It would be a shame
to leave Spain before I saw the two largest cities. I'll keep you all posted
about my last adventures. Happy July everyone!</span><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_7553.JPG"><img alt="IMG_7553.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/07/IMG_7553-thumb-200x150-401938.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0px auto 20px;" height="195" width="261" /></a></p>

We met the renowned Dr. Pieter Muysken and shared information about our research with his lab. We were welcomed with smiles and after the presentation received encouraging advice for how to continue to analyze our data from Palenque. I've officially finished coding, and am in the beginning stages of analysis. Thus far I am faced with an interesting dilemma: I have so much data that I often don't know where to begin each time I look at it. However, I continuously stumble upon new and interesting realizations. Today, Dr. Muysken helped me to sift through the vast sea of questions that I am encountering. I am thankful for the opportunity to be working with him.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">My second favorite thing that happened this week was a trip to Berlin, Germany. This was our third trek to Germany since arriving in NIjmegen, (the first was a bike trip, the second a day trip to Cologne) and I'm loving our neighboring country more and more each visit. We went on a three hour walking tour of Berlin during which we saw the Berlin Cathedral, part of the Berlin wall, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and Checkpoint Charlie. We also stood on the land under which Hitler's bunker resided, where he committed suicide in 1945. To my surprise, we also saw the hotel where Michael Jackson held his baby from the balcony. I was also able to meet up with another friend from Penn State while there, making the trip even more fun and special! </span></p><br /></span> <div><span id="docs-internal-guid-41557d91-ef31-a0c7-2a89-494bd09e4728"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/I-gm9Np91Cy5ILCEyvCyxWTmHNou3HiMmGrbwWtpwRCO06EwNOLibWMwsXQWYP8FnB4xlKOQxIqdWd3fL3ot5Hf9uoHs-lvnBvdO4Lx908Brp0rqAHiFhcTrdEf-GH0Stg" width="624px;" height="468px;" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" /></span></span></div>]]>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fours weeks have gone by so fast. One of my favorite things about being in Europe right now is the World Cup. So far I have travelled to Belgium, Germany, and of course the Netherlands and everywhere I go I feel the pride of each country that I would not be as obvious if the tournament was not going on. Unfortunately, our latest trip to Berlin had us arrive after the Germany vs USA game, but we still got to see endless amounts of people sporting Germany jerseys, probably traveling somewhere to watch the game at an outdoor display. We did get to watch Holland beat Chile at an outdoor display that was in a square in the center city of Nijmegen. I felt immersed in the culture wearing a Holland scarf standing in a sea of orange jerseys and countless other orange attire. The celebration after the win was a really unique experience. Walking through the streets was just a giant Holland party.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This past weekend Jenny, Danny, Mary Beth, and I went to Berlin. We took a walking tour during which we got to see and hear about the rich history of the city. It was strange to me to be in a place where the history was still very recent. I think of WWII being so long ago and it is very easy to think about it as ancient history since it didn't affect my life, but it's events still affect the city today. Buildings that were bombed were still being rebuilt, the Berlin wall is still standing in parts of the city, and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe was only finished in 2004. The city was enormous. Only now do I appreciate how peaceful Nijmegen is. It is the perfect size for biking and although it is a city full of college students it is still quaint and relaxing. It feels like home when I come back from such large, busy cities.</span></p><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/10509610_10201276439513461_5800578788773496862_n.jpg"><img alt="10509610_10201276439513461_5800578788773496862_n.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/10509610_10201276439513461_5800578788773496862_n-thumb-200x150-401918.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></div><div>







<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Danny, Mary Beth, and I presented our research at a biweekly Radboud CLS meeting. I was a little bit nervous, especially because that was the first time we met our advisor, the renowned Pieter Muysken. My nervousness quickly disappeared after the presentation because all the professors were so personable and genuinely interested in our projects. We had lunch with a few of them afterwards and again they liked hearing about our research as much as we liked hearing about their backgrounds. Today was our first meeting with Prof. Muysken. Until today I have been very flustered as to how to analyze some of the data I collected. A part of my experiment involves my participants correcting sentences and due to the amount of variation I received there are many ways that it can be coded, too many actually. However, Prof. Muysken gave me very good advice for how to approach breaking down those complicated responses. The next weeks are going to involve a lot more coding and correspondence with Prof. Muysken. I am excited to see what else I find in my data.</span></p></div><div><br /></div>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">My last &nbsp;week in Lund has finally come. It has been so easy to get lost out here and disconnect from world ( causing my lack of blogging ;) ) The people here live a calm lifestyle which at first I didn't understand. I was confused when I would get on public transportation and it was silent &nbsp;or &nbsp;see many people out to eat by themselves &nbsp;( and not pretending to be busy on their phones ) Back at Penn State I'm studying speech pathology. Every course that I've taken the teacher always reminders us that the first step is diagnosing a speech disorder is deciding if the patient has a "speech disorder or a speech difference." If your patient is pronouncing "dawg" instead of "dog" it might be because they have a problem with their speech or &nbsp;they simply live in New York City and have formed an accent. As my time passed in Lund I began to apply this lesson to my life. Many Swedish people aren't going to make small talk on the bus with you not because they don't like you but because many Swedish people are shy and don't want to bother a complete stranger. Also eating &nbsp;alone &nbsp;doesn't make you anti-social or lack friends, some people simply want to some alone time that happens to be in public. I could go on and on about all the cultural difference I've experienced while aboard. &nbsp;I think what I'll take away from this experience is that nothing is wrong with your own culture or the new culture you are in. It's just different and seeing these differences is a beautiful thing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This past weekend was Midsommar! This a holiday celebrating the first day of summer. It was a fun day filled strawberries, flower crowns and dancing around the maypole. My roommates and I went to a traditional maypole dance where we tried to follow the locals in their dances. Later that night we had a big dinner at home. Once we were free from our food coma&nbsp;we went out to pick flowers for our flower crowns. The Swedish people believe that on Midsommars night you should place seven different flowers from seven different fields under your pillow. That night you will dream of the man you're meant to be with. &nbsp;Unfortunately for me I dreamt of my mother! But besides that it was a lovely day and a successful Midsommar.<o:p></o:p></span></p><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/MD%40.jpg"><img alt="MD@.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/MD@-thumb-200x112-401833.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Sunday, my departing day, will be bittersweet. I am meeting my mother in Paris. We will spend 3 days there and then head to Ireland to visit our family. As excited as I am for the trip I will miss the friends I've made here. My roommates have been so wonderful. Everyone came from somewhere different . There was Louise, the local Swedish girl who would grow almost all her food and was a "extreme recycleist. " but would never force &nbsp;her extreme lifestyle onto you. She is a great listener and never made a promise she couldn't keep. There was Anna, a PhD student from German. I've never seen a girl &nbsp;eat so much and remain so thin. She spoke her mind and also took everyone's opinion into account. She made everyone feel welcome no matter where she went. &nbsp;Lastly there was Kelly, a girl from the Atlanta. When I first arrived I thought we were have so much in common. As we got to talking we found out we had such different views and lifestyles. Almost every night we would eat dinner t</span></p><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/midsommar%201.jpg"><img alt="midsommar 1.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/06/midsommar 1-thumb-200x112-401828.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">ogether. I think that's what I'll miss the most. Our talks over dinner would last hours discussing anything from the perfect time to have coffee to political views. The dinner table was just one giant melting pot of culture. No one was right and no one was wrong, just honest.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p><br /></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p><br /></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 13px;"><o:p>Friday I will finish my testing! I will end with 20 participants. Although it doesn't seem like a whole lot I am thrilled to end with this many people. &nbsp;Battling against finals and specific &nbsp;requirements made recruiting difficult at times. &nbsp;I was informed that an abstract &nbsp;I submitted to the Mental Lexicon in Queen lakes Canada was accepted ! Lots to look forward to in the coming school year. I know I am first finish my Pire experience. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience . &nbsp;Best wishes to all other students!
