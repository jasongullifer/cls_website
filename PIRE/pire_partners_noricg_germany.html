<strong> Current Projects:</strong> <Br />

The primary goal of the "Neurocognition of Rhythm in Communication Group" (NRC) is to investigate the facilitatory effect of predictive cues on comprehension. Focussing on rhythmic, formal, and emotional cues in communicative signals, we aim to identify factors that modulate the extraction of cues and thus the resulting predictions. Furthermore, we examine the functional and neuroanatomical links between specialized processing systems (speech, language, emotion, attention, and sensorimotor) with respect to these predictive cues. In order to address these matters, behavioural, electrophysiological and brain imaging measures are employed in healthy and patient populations.
<Br /><Br />
<strong>Time, emotion and the sensorimotor system</strong> <Br />
Currently, we are working with Parkinson (PD) patients, individuals with speech dysfluencies, and patients with focal lesions of the basal ganglia (BG) or the cerebellum (CE). By means of behavioral (sensorimotor synchronization) and electrophysiological (ERPs) methods we explore specific aspects of temporal and emotional processing in these groups. Our primary concern is to differentiate the contributions of subcortical structures and their cortical connections in these processes with special interest in the lateralization of the pathology.
<Br /><Br />
<strong>The role of temporal and formal cues in communicative signals</strong> <Br />
Our research is based on the working hypothesis that speech comprehension involves ongoing predictions about future events. Further, we assume that those predictions are established based on cues provided in the ongoing signal. An open question is how cues are extracted and which cues are selected to form predictions. Finally, our research investigates how those predictions facilitate processing.
<Br /><Br />
<strong>The role of emotional cues in communicative signals</strong> <Br />
One contextual aspect that can influence comprehension is the emotional content of a communicative signal. Emotional cues capture attention and therefore support efficient information processing. These can be contained in vocal, facial, and bodily expressions. Congruency between the different modalities facilitates processing, while incongruent cues can hamper comprehension. Methods in use include ERP, fMRI, and behavioral studies with healthy participants as well as patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
