<li><strong>The role of language immersion in modulating the way the bilingual's two languages compete</strong><br />
<a href="people/cook.html">Kylee Cook</a> (undergraduate student) --Tarragona (Spain-- Dr. Rosa
Sanchez-Casas), Summer 2011-- Advisor: Dr. Judith Kroll
<br />
I am conducting an experiment in the Summer of 2011 in Barcelona, under the direction of Professor Albert Costa at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Professor Costa is a leading researcher on issues of language production and the cognitive consequences of bilingualism. The project that I am planning is related to the issues of controlling the two languages when second language learners are immersed in a second language environment during a study abroad experience.
<br /><br />
The design of my study is modeled closely on a set of experiments published by Linck, Kroll, and Sunderman (2009). They compared the performance of a group of classroom learners of Spanish at Penn State with a group Spanish learners who were studying abroad in Salamanca. Both groups were native English speakers at an intermediate level of learning Spanish as the second language. The two groups were compared on two different tasks. In a word comprehension task, they were shown a word in Spanish followed by a word in English and asked to judge whether the second word was the correct translation of the first word.  On half of the experimental trials, the correct response was “yes” because the second word was the correct translation of the first (e.g., hombre-man). The remaining trials required a “no” response and it was these trials that were the focus of the study. Linck et al. included some word pairs that were not translations but that were similar to one another either because one word looked like the translation of the other (e.g., the word hambre in Spanish, which means hunger, looks like word hombre), because one word was similar to the form of the translation (e.g. the word mano in Spanish, means hand) or because one word was related in meaning to the other (e.g., the word mujer in Spanish, means woman). By comparing the time to reject these similar word pairs as not being translations relative to completely unrelated word pairs, Linck et al. were able to measure the degree to which learners were confused by words that were similar in word form to the first language translation or similar in meaning. They found that learners who were immersed in Spain during study abroad did not reveal any sensitivity to the related word pairs that were similar in form although they were very sensitive to words that were similar in meaning. By comparison, the classroom learners at Penn State were very sensitive to the similarity of word form. Linck et al. concluded that the reduced sensitivity to word form for the immersed second language learners occurred because they were inhibiting their native language, English, while living in a Spanish environment.
<br /><br />
To further test the inhibitory hypothesis, Linck et al. (2009) asked participants to perform a verbal fluency task in which they were required to name as many items as they could retrieve for a specific category in a 30 second period. They produced the names of words in categories for both English and Spanish in different blocks of trials. They found that immersed learners produced more words in Spanish than classroom learners, suggesting that immersion creates higher proficiency. But they also found that immersed learners produced fewer words in English than the classroom learners, supporting the hypothesis that they were inhibiting their native language while immersed in a second language. In the planned study, I will test American university students who are studying abroad in Barcelona for the Summer of 2011. I will attempt to identify students who have just arrived following the Spring 2011 term in the US and other students who have been in Barcelona for a number of months.

<li><strong>Understanding Gender Processing in Dutch-Speakers Through the Use of Eye-Tracking</strong><br />
<a href="people/graham.html">James Graham</a> (undergraduate student) --Nijmegen (The Netherlands--
Dr. Janet van Hell), Summer 2011-- Advisors: Drs. Giuli Dussias &
Janet van Hell
<br />
The project, to be undertaken at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, will involve operation of an eye-tracker to study sentence processing in reading and auditory comprehension among Dutch-speaking participants. These participants will be shown a two-picture display while simultaneously listening to a Dutch sentence and instructed to click on the one named object. The object will always be preceded by a definite article, in Dutch: de and het, the common and neuter articles, respectively. Unlike most languages, the gender distribution in Dutch is skewed to such an extent that the common gender is more prevalent at a roughly two-to-one ratio to the neuter. The participants of this study will be tested in four conditions split by gender: same gender and different gender trials. This division by gender will allow an examination of differential processing patterns in the human brain based upon the displayed object’s gender.

<li><strong>Does gender transparency enhance processing?: A visual world study of grammatical gender processing in L2 speakers</strong><br />
<a href="people/hollister.html">Nathan Hollister</a> (undergraduate student) --Granada (Spain, Dr.
Teresa Bajo), Summer 2011-- Advisor: Dr. Giuli Dussias
<br />
The fundamental question behind my PIRE research project is the following: Are proficient English-Spanish bilinguals able to use gender information encoded in an article to facilitate the processing of the following noun, like native Spanish speakers do (e.g., Lew-Williams & Fernald, 2007)?  My experience as an English-Spanish speaker leads me to ask yet another question. Is the purported facilitative effect that results from a congruent article and noun combination modulated by whether the noun carries transparent or opaque gender? In Spanish, most nouns either end in –o or –a, which makes the correlation between noun ending and grammatical gender is transparent. For example, nouns ending with the morpheme -a tend to correlate very highly with feminine gender and nouns ending with the morpheme -o tend to have a high correlation with masculine gender. However, there is also a group of nouns that end in consonants. For these nouns, it does not seem obvious what their gender is. To illustrate, the noun luz (light) ends in –z and it is feminine. In my work, I will use the visual world paradigm to examine the effect that transparent and opaque genders has during auditory processing in second language speakers of Spanish. My initial hypothesis is that processing will be facilitated when the gender of the noun is transparent as opposed to opaque.
<br /><br />
My project will test three different groups: English-Spanish bilinguals at Penn State, Spanish-English bilinguals at the University of Granada, and Spanish monolinguals at the University of Granada. This will allow me to compare the results of the two groups of bilinguals to a control group of monolinguals.

<li><strong>Phonological and Prosodic Differences in Word Production and Comprehension between German and English</strong><br />
<a href="people/leimkuhler.html">Rebecca Leimkuhler</a> (undergraduate student) --Leipzig (Germany, Dr.
Sonja Kotz), Summer 2011-- Advisor: Dr. Carrie Jackson
<br />
In my project, I will study the effect of cognates in both comprehension and production among German-English bilinguals. Participants will complete two primary tasks, a lexical decision task and a word-naming task, in which we will include cognates that are identical in pronunciation, as well as cognates that differ in pronunciation at the segmental level and cognates that have different stress patterns between English and German. This study will complement work currently underway examining similar issues in Spanish and English.
<br />
<li><strong>Lexical triggering and codeswitching in Spanish-English bilinguals</strong><br />
<a href="people/negron.html">Rachel Negron</a> (undergraduate student) --Tarragona (Spain-- Dr.
Rosa Sanchez-Casas), Summer 2011-- Advisor: Dr. Janet van Hell
<br />
The project that I am interested in performing during the eight weeks of research abroad is a study based on a project created by Dr. J.G. van Hell which was conducted on  Dutch-English bilinguals. I will conduct the same study using Spanish-English bilinguals  instead of Dutch-English bilinguals.  The project focuses on code-switching which is the use of 2 languages in one utterance, or switching between languages.  More often than not, code-switching is an effortless and intentional process for bilinguals although the question is raised as to why exactly code-switching occurs and what the costs of code switching are.  More specifically the project focuses on the triggering hypothesis and how two types of triggering: cognate triggering and socio-contextual triggering affect the code-switching process.
<br /><br />
Spanish-English bilinguals will be presented with pictures, digits, or isolated words and will respond either orally or digitally with the push of a button. By elaborating on Dr. J.G. van Hell’s study, a better understanding will be attained as to why code-switching occurs, what the costs and benefits of code-switching are, if the costs of switching are absolute and if the cost can decrease.  In addition, Spanish-English bilinguals tend to code-switch significantly more than other bilinguals therefore I anticipate the potential for some variation in results and conclusions that would be interesting to compare to the Dutch-English study.
<br /><br />	 
I have chosen the University of Tarragona, Spain location because the professor that works there, Dr. Rosa Sanchez-Casas, is conducting relevant studies (understanding the cognitive processes that allow bilingual speakers to keep their two languages apart during speech production) to the ones I will be working on at Penn State.  There I will also have access to Spanish-English bilinguals: the two languages I have proposed to study for my project.  Furthermore, I am familiar with the language which will make the experience more personal and allow me to work with bilingual individuals like myself.

<li><strong>Grammatical gender processing in L2 speakers of Spanish: Does cognate status help?</strong><br />
<a href="people/perrotti.html">Lauren Perrotti</a> (undergraduate student) --Granada (Spain, Dr.
Teresa Bajo), Summer 2011-- Advisor: Dr. Giuli Dussias
<br />
I am working on my honors thesis research for the Schreyer Honors College. Professor Giuli Dussias will serve as the advisor on the project. I am using eye-tracking equipment to study whether native English speakers can use grammatical gender in Spanish to facilitate the processing of nouns, as native speakers do.  These English-Spanish bilinguals, for whom grammatical gender is absent in their first language, are highly proficient in Spanish with a mastery of the Spanish grammatical gender system. 
<br /><br />
I will use the eye-tracking equipment to study spoken language comprehension, specifically with the visual-world paradigm technique. Previous findings from Professor Dussias’ lab show that English-Spanish bilinguals do not use grammatical gender in articles to facilitate processing of upcoming nouns. However, the question I will be asking investigates how English-Spanish bilinguals process grammatical gender when it is modulated by cognate status. Research shows that cognate words are easier to learn and behave differently than non-cognates. I am studying whether non-native Spanish speakers are able to use gender information to anticipate when words are cognates vs. when they are not.
<br /><br />
The materials will include 80 pictures referencing feminine nouns and 80 pictures referencing masculine nouns. Half of these will be cognates. I will be recruiting student participants in the Department of Spanish at Penn State.
<br /><br />
I will be continuing this research at the Universidad de Granada. Although previous studies have shown that native Spanish speakers use grammatical gender to anticipate nouns, it will be necessary to replicate these results with the above materials. It is essential to show that the monolingual speakers of Spanish do not show any differential effects when processing words that are cognates with English.
<br />
<li><strong>Using ERPs to investigate the interaction of verb bias and plausibility in Spanish-English bilinguals</strong><br />
<a href="people/kroff.html">Jorge Valdes Kroff</a> (graduate student) --Granada (Spain, Dr. Teresa
Bajo), Spring 2011-- Advisor: Dr. Giuli Dussias
<br />
Monolingual research has shown that people make use of subtle verb bias information when comprehending both written and spoken language. Verb bias refers to the complement preferences of verbs that emerge in speakers even when some verbs share similar options for syntactic complements. For example, the verbs believe and confirm can both optionally take direct objects or sentences as complements. Yet English speakers show preferences for producing and comprehending believe with a sentence (SC-Bias) and confirm with a direct object (DO-Bias) as illustrated:<br />
	(1)	a. Mary believed the story was accurate. (preferred by English speakers)<br />
		b. Mary believed the news.<br />
	(2)	a.  Mary confirmed the story was accurate.<br />
		b.  Mary confirmed the news. (preferred by English speakers)<br />
<br /><br />
In addition, cross-linguistic studies have shown that these biases can differ across language even in cognate verbs, e.g. confirm/confirmar is DO-Bias in English and SC-Bias in Spanish. These observations lead to several questions.  1) Are second language learners successful in learning these subtle cues? 2) Do the linguistic systems of bilinguals interact showing convergence or bidirectional influence? 3) Does language immersion influence dynamic changes in the bilingual comprehension system? 
<br /><br />
In order to shed light on these questions the current study will investigate English reading comprehension in Spanish (L1) - English (L2) bilinguals living in Granada, Spain using event related potentials (ERPs) by manipulating cross-linguistic verb bias information. Psycholinguistic researchers make use of signature electro-physiological components associated with semantic and grammatical integration. As such, ERPs are an excellent tool for measuring comprehension with fine-grained time resolution. Because these bilinguals maintain a functional separation between their two languages and are immersed in their native language, Spanish, these results will provide an interesting comparison to Spanish-English bilinguals living in the U.S. This planned comparison will help us in our understanding of the dynamic bilingual mind.

<li><strong>The Relationship between Theory of Mind, Language Processing, and Executive Function Tasks in English- and Mandarin-speaking Preschool Children</strong><br />
<a href="people/wasilus.html">Nicole Wasilus</a> (undergraduate student) --Beijing (China--Dr. Hua
Shu), Summer 2011--Advisor: Dr. Carol Miller
<br />
At Beijing Normal University, I will continue my research on theory of mind with Dr. Carol Miller in a cross linguistic design, using Mandarin speaking preschoolers. Our research examines the relationship between theory of mind, language processing, and executive function tasks in preschool children. With the help of our foreign partner, Taomei Guo, along with her undergraduate and graduate students, we will translate the test into Mandarin and make any necessary cultural adjustments (e.g., using Chinese toys) in order to replicate our current study with Mandarin speaking children. We will use tests similar to those we administer here, including: false belief, fast mapping, a standardized language test, working memory, and syntactic bootstrapping tasks. Although there is research on theory of mind in Mandarin speakers, the relation between theory of mind and language processing remains to be explored. The purpose of our research is to discover if relationships between theory of mind and language performance are similar in Mandarin- and English-speaking preschoolers.

<li><strong>Unifying Lexical Development: Acquisition, Interaction, and Attrition</strong><br />
<a href="people/zinszer.html">Benjamin Zinszer</a> (graduate student) --Beijing (China--Dr. Hua
Shu), Summer 2011--Advisor: Dr. Ping Li
<br />
Lexical categorization poses a special challenge for bilinguals. Because languages do not always organize objects and events into the same set of like-named groups, bilinguals must manage two often incongruent systems of labels for these items. Bilinguals undergoing first language attrition (those for whom the second language has become dominant through immersion) have been observed to transfer categorization patterns from the second language back into their native language. Previous research has suggested that in some cases even simultaneous bilinguals may form a compromise that combines the two competing categorization systems. Currently, I am developing a computational model based on the self-organizing feature map architecture to make longitudinal predictions about the possible trajectories of development for diverse sets of bilingual learners. My behavioral research in the United States and China will examine the learning and environmental parameters that modulate how bilinguals categorize and name objects in two languages. During the summer research period in Beijing, I plan to develop neuroimaging paradigms to examine lexical categorization in proficient and less proficient bilinguals and identify neural correlates of dynamic changes in first and second language categorization through both fNIRS and fMRI.
