            As I wrap up my time here in Beijing, one thing I'm disappointed about is that I didn't get a chance to the ERP portion of my study, mainly due to time constraints and the grad students here not being traind in the same program that we use in the US. It's still possible I'll be able to do the ERP portion once I return to the US and continue to communicate with grad students in China who can help me collect data in China or return at some point in the future. However, not be able to conduct an ERP experiment still gave me the chance to become more familiar with fNIRS.<br /><br />fNIRS imaging is used to measure the level of oxygenation in different regions of the brain. It has numerous advantages over and EEG machine such as the fact that it tolerates movement more, is easier to set up, is portable and more comfortable. While I didn't get a chance to use the EEG machine at BNU, I did get a chance to observe the fNIRS scanner at BNU being used. From there, I've begun helping my adviser, Ben, analyze fNIRS data and have been reading papers that use fNIRS.<br /><br />Again, I've only just begun understanding how to use fNIRS and how it can apply to my research, but I'm starting to think that as I continue my research, it may be better to use fNIRS instead of ERP. Hopefully, I'll get to chance to use it at some point, either at Penn State or if I return to China at some point.<br />

            So despite already being in Beijing for several weeks, I hadn't actually been to the Great Wall until last weekend. Part of the reason was that I had been more eager to travel to other parts of China and see other sights in Beijing such as the Forbidden City. another reason was that I didn't have the time to make the trek out to it for a day and I wanted to focus on my research. But nonetheless, I finally took the time out to spend a day hiking a section of the Great Wall last Saturday.<br /><br />One thing I had been determined to avoid from the start was going to a section of the Great Wall packed with tourists. For instance, the section of the Great Wall with the most recognizable pictures is called Badaling and I had heard from others that the amount of tourists there really detract from the experience. Having seen firsthand what they meant at other popular sights in China, I started looking at other sections of the Great Wall to visit. I also wanted to go to a section of the Great Wall which wasn't as well-preserved since that would be a more challenging hike.<br /><br />I went to a section called Gubeikou with this company called Beijing Hikers, and I would highly recommend going on hikes with them for any future PIRE students who go to Beijing. The staff were very experienced and friendly. And I met people who came from all over the world while on the hike. Not to mention the food they provided at this small restaurant in an isolated village at the end of the hike was absolutely delicious, and not just because I was starving by the end.<br /><br />But of course, the best part of the hike was being able to see the ruins and the majestic views of this centuries old wonder of the world. Really, my descriptions can't do it justice so I'll just post this picture.<br /><br /><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2012/07/2012-07-14_12-16-25_683-328492.html" onclick="window.open('http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2012/07/2012-07-14_12-16-25_683-328492.html','popup','width=3264,height=1840,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2012/07/2012-07-14_12-16-25_683-thumb-200x112-328492.jpg" alt="2012-07-14_12-16-25_683.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="112" width="200" /></a> <div><br /></div>

            Despite only being in China for less than two months, I'm consistently amazed by how much my Chinese has improved in the little time I've been here.<br /><br />When I first got off the plane, I could barely understand my cab driver as I asked him to take me to my apartment. A few days later, I was starting to be able to have conversations. Two weeks later, I could have full conversations even though I had to ask people to repeat themselves a good amount of times.<br /><br />Before coming here, I thought that I would only be able to communicate with the Chinese grad students in English. I've since found that I've actually used very little English while talking with them and have been speaking mostly Chinese in my day to day life.<br /><br />The one area I've found where my Chinese isn't at a satisfactory level is communicating with participants however. While I can talk about everyday topics in Chinese and give basic requests and instructions, I can't quite adequately explain how to do the the task to participants. This means I've still needed a grad student, Song Shuang, to translate for me but hopefully my Chinese will be at a level where I communicate with participants myself if I ever return to China to do research.<br /><br />I've recently started talking with these two Tibetan guys I met at this restaurant I frequent outside my apartment. One night we'll speak only English so they can practice their English, and the next night we'll speak only Chinese so I can practice my Chinese. We've discussed a variety of topics such as what our lives our like back home, differences between the US and China, religion and even the political status of Tibet. While being able to speak about such complex topics in Chinese was undoubtedly pleasing, I was particularly pleased last night when I was able to discuss my research in Chinese. Previously, I had only been able to adequately explain my research in English. While it was probably a simpler explanation that I would have given in English, I was glad that I was able to convey the point of my research. All in all, I'm going to miss the level if immersion I've experienced here in China. I don't think I would have reached the level where I can discuss such complex topics in Chinese, if it wasn't for PIRE.<br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>&nbsp;This past week was our last week of collecting data here in Granada and it has absolutely flown by, as we have been rushing to try to get in as many participants as we can before we finish as well as making preparations to leave Granada.&nbsp; As luck would have it, Alvaro and I have found new participants at a greater rate this past week than at any other previous time here and have rushed to get them on the schedule to ensure that we would be able to run them on both sessions by the end of the week.&nbsp; Luckily the people that we found were extraordinarily cooperative in working with us to find two separate times that would work for them as well as fit into our available times for our lab space.&nbsp; Wednesday and Thursday, my last two days of running participants, were as full as our lab schedule would permit, which was actually a really great way to end given how many other days I found myself much less busy than I would have liked due to difficulty finding participants.&nbsp; On Thursday I actually ended up spending a total of eight hours just running participants, at the end of which I could barely remember what sunlight looked like as I emerged from our lab in the basement of the library that I have taken to referring to (ever so fondly) as The Cave.&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning Alvaro and I met for the final time to go through all of our data to ensure that it was complete for each of our behavioral tasks and that we both had the files from all of the data we are sharing.&nbsp; He also helped me to go through the data from my own experiment to make sure that the results were spread evenly across my four experimental files.&nbsp; I was so glad to have him there to help me with all of this because he has a great deal of experience with organizing and backing up data, given how many different groups of participants he has run on his current study alone (not to mention he has a bit of OCD going on, which does in fact come in handy in this type of undertaking).&nbsp; We also went through all of our receipts to make sure we had documented all of our participant payments and had added them all up correctly.&nbsp; After making sure that I had all of my equipment and packing up the enormous hard drive containing our data (that I have the distinct pleasure of carrying to safety at PennState) and saying goodbye to Alvaro for the last time that I will be seeing him on this continent, I took my final walk down to the bus stop with mixed emotions (as well as a bit of exhaustion).<br />&nbsp;Earlier this morning as I walked up the steps to get the keys to unlock our lab for the last time, it struck me how long ago it seems that I first walked up those stairs with Alvaro and Amelia the first time we came up to meet with Teresa and everything about the Facultad de Psicologia still seemed so unfamiliar.&nbsp; When I think about every time since then that I have walked up these same stairs as such an ordinary part of my daily life without giving it so much as a thought, it is pretty strange and rather difficult for me to conceive of the notion that I won't be doing so again.&nbsp; I have come to feel so comfortable in this setting that I used to find almost intimidating as I looked at the other members of the lab together or at the groups of undergraduates seated on the front steps talking with friends and felt like I was just a visitor here, looking in at its goings-on from the outside.&nbsp; I of course wasn't able to foresee then that the waiter at the cafeteria would come to know without asking what kind of coffee I would order or that I too would end up sitting on those same front steps with a group of people I had become familiar with.&nbsp; It's really crazy to think that as an undergraduate I've had this chance to get to know this foreign university in such a different way than I would have had I instead been studying abroad and only taking classes.<br />&nbsp;As I finalize travel plans with my mother who is coming to meet me in Spain at the end of the week and as I watch the other girls run about making the final arrangements for their own travels, the reality is beginning to set in that the temporary lives we carved out for ourselves here and the routines we fell into are actually coming to an end.&nbsp; I must admit that it feels good to have completed what I came here to do and to know that I have all of the data I've spent these weeks collecting backed up and ready to go, all of it organized and complete.&nbsp; I am also definitely looking forward to seeing my mom with whom I will be travelling to the north of Spain to take a road trip along the coast.&nbsp; Yet this past week as I have been walking along the streets that have carried me through my days in this city or as I go to sit in a plaza near my apartment or stop into a café that I frequent, a nostalgia has begun to permeate my positive sentiments regarding leaving.&nbsp; The idea that the feeling of ownership that has colored my experience of this place will rapidly fade and next week at about this time I will be closing the door of my apartment here behind me for the last time is really difficult.&nbsp; Two months is a peculiar amount of time to spend in a place because unlike in a study abroad program, in which I would likely have lived in another country for about four or five months, throughout my time here I was quite aware that this would all be ending in what amounted to a matter of weeks.&nbsp; On the other hand, two months is still an adequate amount of time to really grow to know a city well and establish oneself there, particularly as we had our own apartment that we cooked in and kept clean and had a role at the University that structured and lent a sense of purpose to my daily life here.&nbsp; When our group of friends, which was mostly comprised of members of the lab group, all met at a café one night this past week to get together for the last time and say goodbye to everyone, it was hard to divert my thoughts from the idea that this was most likely the last time I would see them again.&nbsp; Attempting to shrug off this sadness and enjoy my remaining time, I have been doing quite a bit of walking around the city these past few days, thinking about all of the positive experiences I have had here, as if seeking to archive it all somewhere in me to hold onto. <br />&nbsp;Looking back on the fairly limited knowledge I had when I first arrived here of what it actually means to conduct research, it is now apparent to me how much I have learned over the course of my time in Granada about the practice of directing a project.&nbsp; With a great deal of instruction from Amelia and Alvaro in areas with which I had no previous experience along with some of my own experimentation, for example in developing my own manner of explaining tasks to participants, I feel that I have been able to gain significant experience in the various aspects of data collection.&nbsp; The first few times I ran a participant I was somewhat hesitant and stumbled over my words a bit as I explained the tasks but after going through it all several times, I became so familiar with repeating those same instructions that I could do so almost without thinking.&nbsp; Much as going through the tasks came to feel so automatic to me and I genuinely enjoyed meeting my participants, each session I run entails five different tasks, so I day in which several were scheduled in a row could certainly feel like a long one.&nbsp; Having some such days that were tiresomely full while others seemed to entail almost too much free time enabled me to see the potential variability in the pace of a research project, as well as to experience the entirely self-directed time management that Amelia indicated to me was more like how graduate school was structured.&nbsp; Preparing for and giving the presentation of my project at our lab meeting here was also an incredibly valuable experience because it provided me with an impetus to structure the ideas and information that underlie my project as well as getting me acquainted with speaking about it in front of a group in a more formal setting.&nbsp; Even just repeatedly explaining my project to various people, such as participants who were curious as to the particulars of the experimental tasks they had just completed, has gotten me to a point at which I feel entirely at ease talking about it. My experience in Granada has provided me with so many opportunities to learn about research, to get to know this city and other parts of Spain, and more generally to get used to living independently and being entirely responsible for myself.&nbsp; I am both tremendously sad to see this time come to a close and appreciative that I have gotten so much out of it to take with me going forward. <br />&nbsp;<br /></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The verbal paralysis that when I first arrived here would overcome me each time I was addressed in Spanish and attempted a response has effectively disappeared as my confidence in my speaking skills has grown with increased usage of the language.&nbsp; I have actually become so accustomed to communicating in Spanish that when I go to address someone or begin a conversation when I am in what I know to be a Spanish environment (while I am out in the city or in a group speaking Spanish, for example) my immediate thought process occurs in Spanish, guiding my subsequent remark.&nbsp; Getting to this point that I no longer constantly translate my thoughts from English to be able to articulate them as a series of Spanish words has been crucial in facilitating fluidity in speaking, I feel.&nbsp; What is surprising to me is that this seems to have occurred without my awareness; though I have certainly been making an effort to better my Spanish by using it as much as possible, I have not been specifically focusing on decreasing the influence of English upon my production of Spanish, as it wasn't something that I ever considered.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do still sometimes get a bit flustered if the person with whom I am speaking is clearly having difficulty understanding me and I continue to be unable to express what I am trying to say.&nbsp; Another trend I have noticed is that it becomes easier and more natural to speak in Spanish when I do so for long stretches of time without using any English.&nbsp; So if I spend the whole day communicating in Spanish, I am increasingly able to do so with more fluidity than after I run participants for several hours, with whom I speak in English (as my experiment itself is entirely in English). When I make the switch to Spanish after a period of predominant English use I have found that I initially encounter more difficulty with both understanding and immediately finding the words to express my thoughts, occurring now mostly in English.&nbsp; This often happens after I've been spending time with the other PIRE students, with whom I have admittedly continued to speak almost exclusively in English, though we do seem to codeswitch with greater frequency with words and phrases that we commonly use in Spanish.&nbsp; Although having this option of speaking English with the other girls that I am here with has probably somewhat hindered my improvement in Spanish, I don't feel that it has at all precluded development of my speaking abilities, as indicated by the aforementioned changes I've noted. <br />Looking through the results of some of the behavioral tasks such as the DELE, a multiple choice reading comprehension task in Spanish, the level of Spanish proficiency of some of my participants is lower than I had anticipated; their responses to the Language History Questionnaire that they complete before being scheduled indicated a level of exposure and usage of the language that would seem to suggest a better handle of it.&nbsp; It has been the English teachers that I have recruited to participate either by contacting language schools or by the recommendations of other participants I've run that have not performed as well as expected on the Spanish behavioral tasks.&nbsp; Although this is surprising to me given that they have all been living in Spain for at least two years and many of them even longer, I suppose that the environment in which many of them spend the majority of their time doesn't necessarily lend itself to frequent use of Spanish.&nbsp; The English teachers who have had lower scores in the Spanish tasks spend all day either instructing their students as to the particulars of the English language or engaging with fellow English-speaking instructors.&nbsp; Many of them have also mentioned that they have a significant other who is a native English speaker or that they speak in English with many of their friends in Granada.&nbsp; This greater exposure to their native language seems to preclude veritable immersion in their L2 and their somewhat lower level of Spanish proficiency calls into question whether they are to be considered as true bilinguals.&nbsp;&nbsp; As my study really seeks to investigate the effects on verb bias tendencies upon English- Spanish bilinguals who are truly immersed in their second language environment, I believe that the data from some of my participants will ultimately have to be thrown out.&nbsp; Another difficulty that I have run into with collecting data has been that participants that have been scheduled will either not show up to complete the experiment or will cancel repeatedly and ask to reschedule.&nbsp; Aside from being rather frustrating, this is also problematic because no-shows and last minute cancellations don't enable us to remove them from the schedule with adequate notice to free up that time slot for another participant, which is unfortunate given how many of us are trying to use a limited amount of lab space.&nbsp; Although I have admittedly been ready to simply give up trying to schedule participants who have been unreliable, inclined to assume that they will never actually be able to make it, Alvaro has assured me this not uncommon in recruiting people for studies as everyone has busy lives and has encouraged me to be patient and just consider this part of the process.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;In a (perhaps somewhat desperate?) last-minute attempt to get more participants on the schedule for next week and make the most of the last of our time here, I began to make accounts on conversation exchange websites for Granada on which people seeking to further their language skills are able to get in contact with each other (in a totally secure, non-online-predator way; no actual personal information was required, I promise).&nbsp; On these sites individuals post a profile in which they indicate their native language, as well as the language they are seeking to practice and their level of proficiency in this language.&nbsp;&nbsp; My intent was to look for native English speakers in Granada who indicated in their profile that they had been living in Spain for at least two years and send them a message with some information about participating in my experiment.&nbsp; Ironically, their intention in joining such a conversation exchange forum is to practice their Spanish, yet my sole purpose in utilizing this type of networking tool has been quite oppositely to contact people on the basis of their native language.&nbsp;&nbsp; An amusing side effect of this little recruitment strategy of mine is that the pathetically unimaginative profiles that I have created, truly devoid of any actual information, seem to be full of promise, as my email inbox is increasingly cluttered with notifications that I have received messages of Spanish speakers looking to practice their English.&nbsp; I have actually already gotten in touch with a woman who meets the requirements for my study and has indicated that she would be interested in participating, but have not yet had any other successes.&nbsp; If everyone that is scheduled through next week shows up though we will have more than 30 participants, which we ended up conceding would be a reasonable target when it became increasingly apparent that our participant group would be inhibitively difficult to pin down. <br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            &nbsp;This past week seemed to have been more filled with activity than any other period of my time here since perhaps the first few days after arriving in Granada.&nbsp; The beginning of the week was absorbed with fairly intensive preparations for our somewhat formidable (or so it felt to me) presentation that we gave at this week's lab meeting on Wednesday morning.&nbsp; I must say that without Amelia's extensive help in analyzing the data I have so far to be able to include my preliminary findings in the presentation and suggest what they might indicate, I would have been hopelessly lost in terms of making sense of the raw data.&nbsp; The two nights before our presentation were spent sitting for hours on our living room couch at our apartment with Amelia, who individually showed Clair, Emily and I how to use the program to run the statistical analysis on our respective data.&nbsp; As we are each using the moving window paradigm and measuring the average reading time per word, she helped each of us to identify which words would be most important to look at for the purpose of examining the results of the critical region for each of our experiments.&nbsp; Amelia then walked us through how to do the statistical analysis for the reading times of each of these respective words and pointed out which of the resulting numbers we needed to look at to get a sense of what our data was indicating so far.&nbsp;&nbsp; After she showed us how to make graphs of these figures to enable us to better evaluate our findings as well as to include them in our PowerPoints, she offered to talk through with us how the trends exhibited in our graphs were related to what each of our experiments test.&nbsp; When we looked at my graphs it appeared that my participants were manifesting longer reading times in the critical region for the conditions in which the complement that followed the verb did not accord with the reader's expectations, as established by its "bias."&nbsp; This was indicative that verb bias was taking precedence in guiding the readers' sentence processing, as is the case with native English speakers in their L1 environment, a finding that is consistent with my predictions.&nbsp; As I only had data saved for 13 participants, however, the averages were not yet statistically significant so it remains to be seen if this will continue to be the case as I look at the data from a larger group of participants.&nbsp; Given that none of the three of us have experience with data analysis, it was absolutely crucial that Amelia was so willing to put so much time and effort into ensuring that we were all confident that we were able to speak comfortably about our work so far.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;The presentation itself went fairly well, though I suspect that my somewhat more than slight anxiety was fairly evident, particularly when I first began talking (rapidly, rather mechanically and with the occasional seemingly interminable pause).&nbsp; Once I got into it a bit however, I became more comfortable and started to speak more naturally, as if I were just having a conversation with someone about the work I was doing rather than standing up in front of a group of dauntingly bright individuals.&nbsp; I was also extremely impressed with Emily and Clair, both of whom spoke with a great deal of confidence and did an awesome job of clearly explaining their projects and what their data has indicated so far.&nbsp; It was really affirmative to see that the people from the lab seemed genuinely interested in learning more about verb bias, which is what Amelia, Emily and I are each looking at with our projects, and were asking questions that I felt reflected a real desire to better understand the underpinnings of our research.&nbsp; But what really made me feel great that morning, regardless of the outcome of the presentation itself, was when a member of the group that I barely knew, having had only had a few brief conversations with her, came and talked with me briefly before the meeting.&nbsp; Perhaps struck by the deer-in-the-headlights air I was likely exuding, she sat down next to me outside of the room in which the meeting was to be held and reassured me that the tone of the weekly meetings really was above all casual and relaxed and that everyone would just be interested to hear more about how things had been going with our work during our time in Granada so far.&nbsp; Although my project is absolutely nowhere near the level of that of anyone working in Teresa's lab, given that my time in Granada has served as my real initiation into research, her comments made me feel like I was one of her peers.&nbsp; Above all, this experience of presenting my research in Spanish will definitely serve to undercut any misgivings I may have about the presentation I will be giving at the CLS meeting in the fall, as speaking about my project in English&nbsp; is comparatively innocuous. <br />&nbsp;This past Monday ushered the Festival of Corpus Christi, which is said to be the biggest celebration of the entire year in Granada.&nbsp; If I thought that the process that commenced last week of adorning virtually every single street in the city with lights was any indication of the scale of the celebration that would occur, I was quite mistaken.&nbsp; The entire affair began on Monday night with the opening of the "Feria" in a complex on the outskirts of the city, which is a typical fair like one that would be found in the United States with rides, massive stuffed animals and stalls offering an astonishing variety of fried foods.&nbsp; I didn't end up making my way over there until Sunday however, an endeavor that left me with the impression that I could just as well have foregone the experience without any real loss.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the evening that Clair and I headed over to the fairgrounds to have a go at the rides, we found ourselves on the bus back to our apartment roughly ten minutes after arriving.&nbsp; As it turns out, the "Swinging Ship" ride would be more appropriately titled "Careening Ship," and what appeared to us to be a gentle, gliding back and forth motion was more of a violent lurching, prompting a minor anxiety attack on Clair's part and incapacitating nausea on mine.&nbsp; The real festivities in the downtown area began on Wednesday afternoon when, as I was taking the bus back from the university, I was confronted with a veritable army of people converging upon one of the major streets of the city.&nbsp; They had gathered to observe "La Tarasca," a traditional parade that takes place every year as part of the festivities in which the central figure in the procession is a statue of a woman on a dragon.&nbsp; The following morning was the parade for the Corpus Christi, the main day for the religious aspect of the Festival about which I know effectively nothing other than its general significance underlying the events of this week.&nbsp; This parade was a bit longer than the Tarasca and consisted of the procession of a large throne carried by a group of people, along with a series of individuals holding up ornate tapestries affixed to the tops of poles.&nbsp; The crowds at both of these processions were so immense that we were barely able to see over the sea of heads to get a good view of the actual parades.&nbsp; Regardless, the celebratory atmosphere that pervaded the city throughout the days of the Festival was in itself a great deal of fun and made me really glad that this event coincided with our time in Granada.&nbsp; Such was the scale of the celebrations that the ordinary goings-on of the city halt for the duration of the Festival, and even the entire University closing for both Thursday and Friday, thereby forcing us to take a break from our work and join in..<br />&nbsp;As an International Relations major, I've found it to be a very unique opportunity to be living in Spain during such a critical moment for the country in the financial crisis that is effectively bludgeoning the European Union.&nbsp; Although I will be the first one to admit that I am not as informed as I could be as to the trajectory of the crisis within Spain specifically and certainly fail to understand the economic details of its underpinnings, I have been making an effort to follow the most recent developments while I've been here.&nbsp;&nbsp; As someone who suffers from a fairly entrenched New York Times dependency at home, I have been doing a bit of reading on the subject in the Spanish newspaper El Pais, one of the country's main daily national newspapers.&nbsp; Though certainly quite a bit different from the New York Times, I have found it really interesting to be able to read about the European financial crisis in sources from within the area that is actually experiencing its effects.&nbsp; Reading about Spain's economic circumstances in a Spanish newspaper and being able to walk down the street and see signs in windows advertising "crisis prices" or hear people talking about their concerns has given life to an issue that I would undoubtedly be reading about in an American newspaper if I were at home.&nbsp; Distance and frequent coverage can often have the effect of desensitizing us to situations that seriously impact the lives of other people, a tendency that almost certainly would have been active in shaping my&nbsp; view of this had I not been here in Spain.&nbsp; It is additionally interesting to read reporting about the United States from the standpoint of Spanish press.&nbsp; I read an article in the paper a few days ago about comments made by Obama as to the necessity of a stimulus strategy in Europe to prevent a worldwide recession that would hinder the economic recovery of the United States; the article had made the front page and continued to a spread of three full pages with a large photo included.&nbsp; At first it seemed entirely natural to be reading at such length about my own president, but upon considering how much coverage this same remark had likely received in American newspapers on that day (perhaps a reference to it in a more general article, if anything), it was made me think about how greatly the emphasis placed on an event can differ between two countries that are not drastically different from one another.&nbsp; Having this exposure to foreign news to be able to compare with that of the United States has thus been really valuable in learning to take into account the multiple perspectives from which a certain situation can be documented and thus to consider a source critically rather than just reading a story and accepting it as fact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <div class="asset-body">
            &nbsp;At the lab meeting next Wednesday we will each be giving a presentation of our research project to the lab group, in which I am planning to provide an explanation of what my experiment seeks to investigate, offer the outcomes I expect and why and present the data from the participants that I have already run.&nbsp; Because Emily and I created our materials together and are just running different participant groups on the same experimental files, we will be presenting our projects together and each explaining what we intend to look at with our respective groups of subjects.&nbsp; Aside from the Young Scholar Speaker Series poster session this spring for which we submitted posters and just answered specific questions that people asked about our projects, this will be my first experience actually presenting my project in its entirety.&nbsp; I think that the preparation that I am doing for this presentation will also serve to enable me to assess where I am at in the trajectory of my research, which I think will be beneficial given that I have been more engaged in the more immediate tasks involved in the project and haven't stepped back to consider it as much since I've begun collecting data.&nbsp; As this is my first real presentation of my project I would admittedly be more comfortable doing it in English because I have ample confidence in my ability to articulate myself in such a formal context in English and I regret to say that the same cannot quite yet be said of Spanish.&nbsp; Fortunately, Amelia, Emily and I, and Clair will all be presenting our projects at the same meeting, which makes the idea of speaking in front of the group a bit less nerve-wracking because the focus of our audience will be somewhat diffused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately I won't have as much data as the three of them, as I have run significantly fewer participants up to this point.&nbsp; Although I have been made to feel beyond welcome by the lab group as a whole, I am definitely feeling nervous about getting up in front of this group in particular to discuss my experiment due to insecurities regarding both my own relative inexperience in conducting research and in speaking about research in Spanish.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have talked with a few members of the lab group about my presentation and they have been helpful in resolving some of my concerns, assuring me that everyone understands that we are not well-established in research careers, but rather undergraduates who are here to learn from the experience of conducting our own projects while living in a Spanish immersion environment.&nbsp; Amelia has also assured us that she will be willing to help us put together the presentation and to answer any questions we have in terms of phrasing things properly in Spanish and using the correct vocabulary to describe our experiments.&nbsp; Knowing that I will have this additional resource as I begin to plan has significantly increased my confidence that I will not be a heinous embarrassment.&nbsp; Upon rereading this paragraph, it has occurred to me that this is likely to cause a bit of unease with what I am sure could be taken as a rather dire portrait I have painted of my present state; I feel that I should include probably include a disclaimer that I do tend to veer sharply toward neurotic in matters relating to my own performance, even when there is absolutely no cause for concern. <br />&nbsp;In preparation for the presentation, Alvaro and Amelia have begun to walk us through the process of looking through our data and preparing it for analysis.&nbsp; They have shown us how to use the program E-merge, a program with which I was entirely unfamiliar, as I had no previous analysis with data analysis with the research that I was involved with at Penn State.&nbsp; Although the programs we used seemed to provide an abundant opportunities to make mistakes, Alvaro was extraordinarily helpful in showing us what we needed to do and was more than willing to patiently provide answers to all of our questions (of which I certainly had quite a few!) and to re-explain certain steps when necessary.&nbsp; The guidance that Amelia and Alvaro have offered to us in various areas of our projects has been fantastic, especially as they are each working on their own respective research during their brief time here and are already quite busy.&nbsp; As the five of us were all seated around our living room at our apartment with our computers out I was struck by how lucky I am to have this group of people to whom I can turn any time I need anything or have any questions, and how much this has added to what I have been able to do with my project here in Granada.&nbsp; I know that I would not have learned anywhere near as much about research if Amelia and Alvaro had not been here to answer all of the questions that I have asked them with regards to my specific project as well as to their experience in conducting research and as graduate students in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;During the process of working on my own experiment rather than just assisting with a certain part of someone else's project, I have come to understand that the data collection phase entails so much more than merely explaining an experimental task to a participant and leaving them to complete it.&nbsp; There are additionally a variety of other aspects to keep, such as sending reminder emails the day before to all of the participants scheduled for the following day, determining the correct payment for each participant given the amount of time they have spent completing the experiment and subsequently calculating the dollar amount based on the current exchange rate, making sure that I always have proper change with which to pay participants, keeping a spreadsheet with all of the participant responses to LHQs updated.&nbsp; I have found that one of the most important of these additional aspects of this phase of my project has been the ongoing correspondence that I have maintained with each potential participant by email and phone to ensure that they complete the Language History Questionnaire, to find convenient times to schedule two separate sessions and to answer any questions they may have about participating in the experiment.&nbsp; Not having internet in our apartment has also required that we frequent locations that offer free wireless in order to be able to continue recruiting people through email and to ensure prompt responses to participants.&nbsp; Naturally, this has resulted in a friendship with the owner of a café a few blocks from our apartment whose wireless we make use of for hours at a time on a pretty much daily basis in exchange for a coffee and .&nbsp; Amusingly, we have also discovered that by making an account on a website we can access 30 minutes of free wireless per day in one of a series of plazas throughout the city.&nbsp; So I also tend to regularly find myself seated on a bench in a public plaza with my laptop, frenetically typing or speed-reading in order to ensure that I am absolutely maximizing the utility of the precious internet access, much to the curiosity of onlookers who are seated at other nearby benches, engaged in more ordinary bench activities (reading a newspaper, conversing with a friend, eating an ice cream, ect).&nbsp; Another element that I had not at all anticipated to be something that would factor significantly into my time has maintaining contact with my family members and friends from home by email and, very rarely, Skype.&nbsp; The truth is that I have even been somewhat negligent in this regard, being as I am occupied with such a variety of tasks, and I'm sure that keeping up with such correspondences would be even more time-intensive if I were to dedicate additional effort to it.&nbsp; Having such a variety of engagements to keep up with every day is much more comfortable for me than feeling that my time is not adequately filled, but it also seems to be having the effect of making the time here feel like it is absolutely racing by.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Although I should probably refrain from mentioning this given that it was Giuli's last caveat in saying goodbye to us before we departed for Spain, I encountered a fairly substantial strike taking place on the main street that passes through the center of the city, as I was walking back to our apartment from the university.&nbsp; I had already been aware of the strike because my last participant was unable to make it up to the campus as the buses through the city had been rerouted to accommodate the crowds that filled the streets throughout the main downtown area.&nbsp; It had also been widely advertised by fairly ubiquitous posters throughout the city as well as general word of mouth for several weeks.&nbsp; The event was in protest of (I believe) recent budget cuts that resulted in decreased funding for various levels of public schools throughout the country.&nbsp; What I thought most interesting was that the crowd in the street did not appear to have gathered as a result of the organizing efforts of a single group but was instead comprised of a multitude of smaller groups, each of whom were wearing their own respective attire, carrying signs with their own messages and shouting or singing their own slogans but all of whom were there to support the same underlying purpose.&nbsp; Amongst the protesters were university students, elderly couples, families with tiny children.&nbsp; The tone of the event was not characterized by aggression but rather seemed to be centered around expression of values, and the actions of those present did not convey hostility but rather what I perceived to be a sense of community in their shared intentions.&nbsp; I thought it was so awesome to see such variety among those participating in the demonstration, as to me it reflected a culture in which the act of collectively articulating one's convictions is considered to be of substantial value across demographics.&nbsp; Keeping my promise to Giuli, however, I refrained from further diversifying said demographic by grabbing a sign and adding myself to the mix...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;This past week I also made travel arrangements to take a weekend trip by myself to Nerja, a small town comprised of a cluster of whitewashed buildings through which narrow streets (and, truth be told, THRONGS of tourists) wander.&nbsp; Situated between a cliff that plunges to the Mediterranean and the Sierra Nevada mountain range to the north, it was certainly a lovely destination for a brief stay, if evidently a bit geared toward accommodating vacationers.&nbsp; I found a single room in a hostal which, though somewhat reminiscent of a prison cell in its lack of window, seemed glorious to me as it marked my first time in arranging for accommodation and staying alone.&nbsp; I also acquainted myself with the excellent bus system that connects a truly impressive variety of locations throughout Southern Spain and enables one to travel at an astonishingly reasonable price.&nbsp; Now that I've seen how easy (and liberating!) it is to make such plans entirely on my own, I will definitely be taking advantage of our amazing location and these resources that are so readily available to travel more whenever my schedule permits.&nbsp;

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>&nbsp;This week I continued to run participants, which for me has been the most enjoyable part of doing research because I have had a series of really interesting conversations with some of my participants regarding their experience as native English speakers living outside of their L1 environment.&nbsp; After completing my experimental tasks, almost every participant I have run has expressed interest in hearing about where I am from, and inquired as to my impressions of the city of Granada and what living in Spain has been like for me.&nbsp; This has prompted several conversations regarding the experience of living in the Spanish immersion environment (in the case of this group, all are L1 English speakers immersed in Spanish) and often results in them sharing their perception of how their English speech has been impacted by the predominant use of Spanish.&nbsp; I have been told, for example, by several people that when they speak to family members in English or when they first started speaking with me, they often experience some difficulty in retrieving the English words to express what they are trying to say, as it is the Spanish word that first leaps to mind. Also, because a significant part of our initial recruitment efforts began with contacting language schools to try to locate English teachers there who are native speakers, many of the participants who are English instructors have described what it has been like to be teaching their native language abroad.&nbsp; Interestingly, many of my participants who are in their early to mid twenties have indicated that education and English had nothing to do with what they studied in college but that they had wanted to live abroad and teaching English was how they were able to do so.&nbsp; Apparently there is a program run by the regional government of Andalucia to which one can apply to be an English teacher in Granada that a number of my participants have told me about, which might be something to look into for the future.&nbsp; It was especially interesting for me to talk with them about the experience of teaching English to native Spanish speakers in the Spanish immersion environment because when I was in high school I had an internship teaching English to native speakers of Spanish who themselves were living abroad.&nbsp; I wasn't actually anticipating learning from my participants themselves while I was here, as I assumed that being native English speakers I wouldn't get much in the way of "exchange" with them, so this has been a positive addition to conducting research.&nbsp; THE MOST EXCITING, however, was the first participant that expressed a genuine interest in hearing about what it was that my project was actually&nbsp; seeking to investigate and continued to ask me questions to ensure that he understood what I was talking about!&nbsp; I certainly had not expected to be discussing verb bias with a 20-something year old who was participating in a paid study.&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; It was also helpful to get used to speaking about my project and to get some additional practice in explaining exactly how my tasks function in investigating the questions that form the foundation of my project.&nbsp; Perhaps I will be more prepared for the fearfully anticipated presentation that we will be giving at our lab meeting quite soon!<br />&nbsp;Much as I have enjoyed running the participants that we have been able to schedule, the process of recruiting continues to be a bit more of a challenge than we had anticipated, which is certainly anxiety-provoking at times because I truly hope to maximize the data that I am able to collect for my experiment during my brief stay here.&nbsp; Many of the language schools that we visited to try to find native English speakers explained to us that this is a particularly busy time for their teachers right now as they are finishing up with their spring classes and are consequently occupied with preparations for exams.&nbsp; In my additional attempts to contact individuals to recruit them to participate, I have been met with a similar response as they have indicated that they simply do not have any room in their schedule at this time. Because the population that we are seeking has necessitated that we look off campus, I have found that it has also been a problem for people to make it up to our lab, which is outside of the immediate center of the city (as well as at the top of a mountain!), given that they are not students who already have to be up here anyway.&nbsp; It seems that so far the most successful method we have found for recruiting has been to simply ask the people that come to complete our experiment if they have any friends or know of any other native English speakers who meet our requirements.&nbsp; Unfortunately, looking for people in this manner does mean that rather than recruiting a certain group of people who would qualify to participate and thus finding several subjects all at once, we will be seeking people on more of an individual basis, which will make corresponding with potential participants an especially significant part of collecting data here. Although it is definitely discouraging to spend a great deal of time contacting people and to hear back from very few (if any) of them, Alvaro has been especially encouraging throughout this process, assuring me that difficulties in finding participants is sometimes part of research.&nbsp; It has been great to have him here to work with me and to be able to ask him questions in areas of research that I am less familiar with.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think that I am making progress in speaking Spanish, in that the act of doing so has begun to seem less intimidating to me and I am more readily involving myself in conversation, hesitating less when spoken to.&nbsp; Truth be told, however, the momentary anxiety that arises as I try to simultaneously select my words with care and verbalize them has not entirely disappeared.&nbsp; I have begun to try to accept the fact that I will inevitably make mistakes in speaking (even Giuli does it sometimes!), but at the same time I will ultimately be able to communicate what it is that I am trying to convey, even if it entails a bit of additional effort to change how I am saying something.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also try to keep in mind that I will never see the majority of the people with whom I interact here after I leave, which does provide a bit of additional comfort.&nbsp; Making these adjustments to the way in which I approach the act of speaking has gone a long way in easing my reluctance to speak, which I think will be critical to improving my Spanish as just putting the language into practice is so important.&nbsp; I am still a bit nervous when I talk with members of the lab group because I know that I will be seeing them quite a bit during my time here and because I am truthfully a bit intimidated by their knowledge of research that far exceeds my own.&nbsp; When we speak with them in Spanish they correct the errors that we make in a way that is genuinely intended to help us improve and is free of judgment, which I have really appreciated because it has made me aware of areas in which I can improve and helped me to keep them in mind. It also helps to know that the vast majority of the people from the lab speak at least two languages so they understand the experience of putting one's second language into use and the discomfort it can entail.&nbsp; Being within the context of the group and having them be so supportive in terms of encouraging all of us to speak in Spanish makes me really glad to be working here with Teresa Bajo and her group and having the opportunity to spend time with and learn from them all.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            Week of May 14th- 18th<br />&nbsp;As our second full week living in Granada comes to an end, the initial novelty of being here seems to have worn off as local tendencies and places that initially seemed so fascinating and unusual have come to feel more like ordinary facets of our life here.&nbsp; Hanging&nbsp; clothes up to dry on our roof, which at first felt like such a charming and somewhat odd alternative to our clothes dryers in the United States, has ceased to feel at all unusual.&nbsp; I am no longer surprised to see families with small children sitting down for dinner at an outdoor café at 11 pm on a weeknight.&nbsp; The inconsistently-timed midday closings of certain retail establishments is something I have adjusted to accounting for, as well as the fact that the city barely exhibits signs of life before 8 am at absolute earliest!&nbsp; I have even grown more accustomed to living within the framework of the slower, more relaxed pace at which daily life here occurs relative to that in the U.S. though it is certainly a tremendous departure from that of life at home.&nbsp; Although this is indeed an oversimplification and certainly varies greatly by degree, it seems to me that in the U.S. there is a much greater pressure to do things in the least amount of time possible, particularly during the work week.&nbsp; This proclivity gives rise to a comparatively frenetic quality to life at home that I barely noticed until arriving here, where there doesn't even appear to be any significant rush hour.&nbsp; Conversing with a few people here who have visited or spent a bit of time in the U.S. has confirmed this impression of a disparity between the pace of life here as compared with that at home and I have come to understand that this "frenzied" nature is a component of the perception of us that is often held outside of the U.S.&nbsp; Much as I must admit that I cannot envision this more laidback lifestyle being one that I could maintain in the long-term , it has certainly been valuable to experience life in an entirely different way than I have previously, rather than just observing it in the way that I likely would have if I only been visiting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it's like trying on a different life for a few months.&nbsp; In addition to these other initial surprises that have now ceased to be noteworthy, the lack of internet access in our apartment is yet another substantial difference that we have gotten used to, as this is a fixture that seems unthinkable to be without in a living space at home (much as it shames me to say).&nbsp; Although it is not something that I tend to notice in the day-to-day, when I step back and consider how I already experience a sensation of familiarity upon returning to our apartment here, it is remarkable that such transition has taken place so quickly. <br />This is not to say, however, that my adaptation to life in Granada has been entirely flawless, as any new circumstances like this is effectively guaranteed to entail some degree of discomfort.&nbsp; I have found that the greatest challenge I have experienced in my time here has been the unanticipated hesitation I have encountered in speaking Spanish, particularly when in larger groups of people who are all engaged in conversation.&nbsp; Although I have for the most part quickly gotten used to the dialectical differences that characterize Andalusian Spanish and thus have little trouble understanding almost all of what is being said around me, I find myself at times powerless to produce much more than a flustered string of words when addressed.&nbsp; As someone who has always had great facility with articulating my opinions and sentiments, this anxiety and reluctance to express myself verbally has been immensely disorienting for me.&nbsp; I am admittedly a bit out of practice in the actual production of Spanish, given that the most recent classes I have taken in the subject at Penn State were in Spanish linguistics and therefore not especially conversation-oriented.&nbsp; It seems to me, however, that my trouble with speaking stems not so much from a lack of practice as from a rather pernicious strain of perfectionism I seem to possess that inclines to speak only when I am perfectly confident that I will be able convey my thoughts without error.&nbsp; The problem is that this usually results in silence.&nbsp; I have talked with the other PIRE students here about this concern and about how they have they been able to overcome such discomfort and they suggested to me that the best way to get past it is to ignore thoughts of making mistakes and just speak.&nbsp; I find that I am getting more comfortable in one-on-one interactions and hope that if I continue in this way I will be able to speak with greater ease.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;The data collection phase of my project has finally gotten underway this week as I have begun to run participants on my experiment, which has given me a sense of efficacy in that I feel that I am concretely moving forward with my project.&nbsp; As Alvaro and I will be using the same group of L1 English participants and need some of the same behavioral tasks for our respective experiments, we have determined that the most efficient way to collect data will be to divide the tasks up such that we each run our own experiment along with a few behavioral tasks.&nbsp; We will therefore collaborate to run each participant such that Alvaro will conduct the first session and I will run the second one, which will consist of my self-paced reading task followed by 4 behavioral tasks on the computer.&nbsp; Although the lab space that Teresa Bajo, our faculty adviser here at the University of Granada, has access to is fairly limited even for the purposes of their own lab group, she has been extremely generous in providing us with a room exclusively for our use for the duration of our time here.&nbsp; At times we will even have access to 2 separate chambers, as there are currently 5 of us that are using the lab space and Amelia and Alvaro both require the chamber with the eye-tracking equipment to run their experiments.&nbsp; I am admittedly a bit discouraged that right now I am running fewer participants than Clair, Emily and Amelia who have had significantly less trouble recruiting participants and have thus been much more active in the collection of data than I have up until this point.&nbsp; I am sure that as we continue our recruitment efforts though we will be able to find more people to run, which will hopefully be further augmented by asking those that we do find if they know anyone else who fits our requirements and might be able to participate.<br />&nbsp;We also attended our first lab meeting for the members of Teresa Bajo's lab this week, which was the first opportunity that I have had to see everyone in the group all at once, having met the group incrementally in a series of separate encounters.&nbsp; I found it to be quite similar in some regards to the weekly CLS meetings at Penn State, with one person presenting research they have been working on while the other members of the lab ask questions and provide feedback as to how they might improve or extend their work.&nbsp; In the same way that I often fail to understand absolutely all of what is being presented during the CLS talks due to my relative lack of experience with linguistics, there was quite a bit from the meeting that I failed to entirely grasp, especially because the presentation made frequent reference to statistical analysis.&nbsp; My less than perfect understanding may also have exacerbated ever so slight by the fact that the entire presentation was given in rapid Spanish... Regardless, I think that the experience of just sitting amongst the entire group and observing the dialogue that developed from the remarks and questions of different people was illuminating in itself.&nbsp; I suppose that I was not previously aware of the degree to which research can be such a collaborative endeavor, with this type of input from one's colleagues serving to productively contribute to furthering one's work.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to continuing to hear about the projects that other members of the lab group are working on as we continue to attend the weekly meetings. <br />&nbsp;Finally, (though this is perhaps not the MOST pertinent to research)this weekend marked my first acquaintance with the Southern coastline of Spain, which lies less than an hour's car ride to the south of Granada.&nbsp; Although I am not typically one to be especially enthused by the act of laying in the direct sunlight for any extended period of time, this particular beach day proved an exception as it was our first "outing" of our time in Granada.&nbsp; As the work that we do for our research has started to develop, we have each increasingly been engaged in our own respective projects, so it was great to be able to spend an entire day with our whole PIRE group as well as a few friends from the lab.&nbsp; I will leave you with the attractive detail that I returned from said beach with a second degree sunburn, complete with extensive blistering, on both of my feet!&nbsp; Ciao!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />

            I am very excited to report that since my last post I have had success finding English-German bilinguals!!! After dozens or emails to every possible contact I could find who might be able to lead me to this population, I began to have small successes. One of these was when a professor, who brings over a group of American university students to Leipzig each year, replied to my email and then forwarded my information to a language school in the city. One of the instructors there contacted me and invited me to visit a couple of their classrooms and explain my study to potential participants. I did this and ended up with four great participants as soon as I finished my introduction! After weeks of flyers, endless emails, and talking to everyone I could about my study, it felt wonderful to finally see the effort pay off. <br /><br />Because it has been so difficult to unearth the population I am interested in testing in Leipzig, Dr. Jackson and I came up with the idea to try something drastic - a trip to the city of Marburg to recruit and test English native speakers who are fluent in German. Marburg is a city in the state of <i>Hessen</i> (remember learning about the Hessian soldiers who fought in the American Revolution in your 4th grade history class?) about an hour north of Frankfurt. Marburg is a relatively small city, but one with a large university filled with both German and international students. Because PSU's German department has some connections in the city, and we knew that there were many Americans who study here, we thought it would be a good place to try to find speakers. <br /><br />After getting approval for this trip from the PIRE PIs (thank you, thank you!), the planning began. Dr. Jackson wrote to a professor at the <i>Universität Marburg</i> to ask about using a lab to test participants. He wrote back immediately and assured us that it would not be a problem. After this was in place, the emailing began. I started by emailing Ashley Roccamo, a fellow CLS member and German department colleague, and asked her to forward on my informational flyer and information about my study to anyone who might fit the participant profile. I also wrote to some linguistic students at the university, who set me up with English speakers they knew. With these emails the "snowball sampling" method was in motion and <i>auf einmal </i>(suddenly) each time I checked my inbox I had new emails from people who were either willing to participate or had more names for me to contact about my study. After a week of constant emailing, I had nine participants scheduled for the two days I would be testing. This number might sound modest, but as I had only been able to test seven participants in Leipzig, this more than doubled my sample number!<br /><br />Testing the German L2 speakers has been the most rewarding thing about my research so far. Perhaps it is all the work that went into finding the participants, or the common bond that many Americans abroad share that made this such a delightful experience - I can not say for sure. Although each participant had to fit a very specific language profile in order to take part, each person had their own unique background experience with the language: many had previous experiences abroad, some were overseas for the first time; a handful had participated in experiments previously, but most were doing it for the first time. The most interesting and surprising thing to me was that nearly all of my L2 speakers were very interested in hearing about the research that I am doing. I expected that students abroad would be mainly interested in the money (who could blame them?) and would be in and out as quickly as possible. How wrong I was! Some stayed long after the testing had concluded to ask me questions and share stories and experiences. When I revealed the specifics of my experiment at the end, many shared annecdotes with me relating directly to the topic I am researching. I even had a couple of undergraduate student participants who were eager to hear more about the field of psycholingustics and wanted advice about how to find out more about continuing their education in this area. <br /><br />I am so thankful to the PIRE PIs who granted me permission to travel to Marburg. Without this trip my sample size would be far too small and I would not have the data that I do. This trip also provided me with yet another chance to meet scholars and researchers in the field and see and use another testing environment. All of these experiences have made me feel much more "at home" in the field and have raised my comfort level substantially. For example, I was apprehensive at first about writing to so many new people -none of whom I knew- to ask for their help with finding participants. I was nervous that people who be unwilling to help and displeased by the intrusion or find my appeals for help a tad too audacious. However, my experiences recruiting in Leipzig and Marburg showed that in fact most people are very willing to help and are happy to take a couple moments out of their busy day to forward an email or suggest a potential participant. Even those that were unable to help were also very gracious and kind and wished my luck with my research. The moral? Be bold, be polite and be persistent - and at some point things will start to fall into place. <br />
