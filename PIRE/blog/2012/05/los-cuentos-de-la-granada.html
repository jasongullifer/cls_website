write that third letter home to tell you how things are going over here. In
short, life is great and Granada is still just as wonderful as it was the first
day I arrived. But if you'd like a more in-depth illustration as to how my
day-to-day life looks over here, by all means, read on!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday May 14&nbsp; -- Today
Clair and I ran two participants. Until this point, we had set up our
participant sharing in such a way that Amelia had been running all the
behavioral tasks during her session and Clair and I would just run our own individual
experiments in our session. However, due to scheduling changes, Clair and I have
begun to run the behavioral tasks as well. Learning by doing, we of course made
an error: we forgot to record the audio for the Boston Naming Task. (Yes, whoops
is right). But now we know and we won't make that mistake next time. On the way
home, I bought some fruta seca (dried fruit) to help balance out all the berenjenas
fritas (fried eggplants) I eat here. Knowing I need to advantage of a health
kick when it comes, I went for a quick jog with Clair at El Parque de Federico Garcia
Lorca. After our run, Clair and I decided to play on the park's zip line. Then
we spent what must have been 45 minutes swinging and laughing together like
children on the playset until the summer night sky turned dark blue. We didn't
want to leave, but the park closes at 10. But when we got back from our run,
Amelia invited us to tapas with her friends, Diego and Ali, who were visiting
from Argentina. I was thrilled to have them with us that night because I got to
pick up some Argentine lexicon amongst all this Granadino phrasing I've been
learning. On the downside, I started realizing today that I was officially sick,
so I stopped at the farmacia on the way home to get some type of medicine to reduce
my throat inflammation. The pharmacist gave me some over-the-counter spray that
ended up not helping much. However, the funny part of this adventure for me was
that, after a certain hour of the night, the pharmacy is open but the door is
closed, so you have to ring the bell and order your medicine through the window
from the street. I felt like Dorothy entering the Emerald City.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday May 15, 2012 -If I have learned anything from my
research here, it's that there exists a fairly reliable formula for participant
attendances/absences: when one participant comes, the next one won't. In
between waiting for participants today, I decided to take a break from
Cafeteria food and ate instead in Albayzin at an Arab restaurant called Kasbah.
I thoroughly enjoy eating by myself here - especially lunch, because I get to
read, collect my thoughts, write, and best of all, listen into the
conversations around me. Listening in on the conversations around me is my
favorite part because it allows me the chance to get practically unlimited comprehensible
input in my L2. However, as it turns out, today the women sitting next to me
were British, so I actually got quite a good deal of L1 input. But I did learn
a little about London by talking with them! At Kasbah, I tried a foreign flavor
of zumo natural (natural juice). It was called Guanabana. It was white and a
bit frothy with a hint of pineapple (pretty refreshing for a hot summer day.) After,
I had some time to kill yet before my next participant, so I strolled around to
get to know the city's side streets a bit better. I stumbled upon a small used
book/cd store in Albayzin. There, I found an Eva Peron chapa (pin) for my
backpack and a Carlos Fuentes book for a total of 1 Euro. &nbsp;But this purchase ended up being a little ominous
because the day after I bought his book, Fuentes died. &nbsp;Odd timing, no? For dinner, I went out to Alta
Albayzin to celebrate my friend Manolo's birthday. !Que guay!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday May 16 - Today was my first weekly meeting with
the department. &nbsp;I went at 9am to the
University and listened as Laura, a grad student from the Facultad de
Psicologia, presented her work to the group. It was in Spanish, of course, and
on a topic that required a lot of statistical jargon. For the most part, I
focused on picking apart and understanding the language. Trying to understand
the complex concepts on top of that would have been mental overload for me.&nbsp; Today I only had one participant. He was very
charismatic. His English was very good, so we had a quick intercambio and each
taught one another words from our respective L1s.Then as usual, I spent the day
sending out emails and scheduling participants. While the research went well, I
have to say the highlight of my day was a purchase I made: bombachos (also
called pantalones anchos or wide pants). These are typical Arab pants that are
worn here. If you've never seen them, Google it! They're essentially the
Andalusian equivalent to Penn State leggings. Out of habit, I went again to
Kasbah for lunch. This time I had couscous con pescado and a maracuya zumo
natural. During my meal, I met Sebastian and Luis, two of the servers at Kasbah.
They told me where to go to take a Flamenco class, so hopefully I actually get
around to signing up so I can write about it for you all in a future blog. On a
slightly less nice note, my throat still hurt and I knew it was getting worse.
Alvaro's mom is a nurse so she recommended medication for me. I grabbed her
recommended medication from the pharmacy and hoped it would work. For dinner
tonight, I had tapas with Melissa, Clair, Alvaro, and his friend Diego.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday May 17 - This was a first: no participants today. I
have to admit that the lack of regularity left me feeling a little sad. I
missed the university! However, I made the most of the beautiful free day by &nbsp;dando vueltas (walking around the city) by
myself. I ate boquarones de vinagre con pan at a restaurant in Realejo and read
at a cafÃ© near Calle Pedro San Antonio. While I was reading at this cafe, I
heard an English speaker trying without much success to ask the waiter a
question. I figured I could help so I told her I speak both English and
Spanish. After having ordered for her, I find out that she lives ten minutes
from my house at home in Pittsburgh. What a small world! After having read
enough, I met up with Alvaro, Amelia, and Diego to hang out and practice my
Spanish. And after that, I had my first Spanish cinema experience! We saw Los
Vengadores (the Avengers). It was a dubbed English movie, but even so, it was
great for my listening skills because I was able to work on my listening skills
without the distraction of me thinking what I'm going to say next (as often
happens to me in conversation). After the movie, I was hungry for a healthy
eight hours so I went right to bed!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Friday May 18 - I woke up on Friday and knew I had strep
throat. I hadn't been able to actually eat hard food for days, and despite the
Spaniards telling me that it was nothing and that I should wait to go to the
doctor, I decided I had to go. I had one participant in the morning, and after
that, I started looking into how to approach the medical system in a foreign
country. However, I was feeling tired and sick and I didn't have the energy to
get myself to the hospital, so I decided I would wait one more day to see if it
would heal on its own. In the meantime, I had to figure out how to pick my
friend Mallory up at the airport because she would be arriving the next day on
a flight from Paris. To get this information, I stopped by the tourist office
in Plaza Mariela and the woman at the desk told me where to go to grab the bus
to the airport. I still had another hour or two before Mallory's flight was due
to land, so for lunch today I grabbed (as usual) a tortilla Espanola and a glass
of water and I read for a little in the open air. I chatted with the camarero
(waiter) a little. He wanted to talk about the stock market, and as a result, I
think it's safe to say that I am acquiring quite an eclectic Spanish vocabulary
during my stay here in Granada. Then 5:00pm rolled around and Mallory arrived!
It was so exciting to have a little piece of home with me here in Spain. I
showed her to her hotel, grabbed a hot beverage with her, and I showed her the
way of el tapeo! My favorite part was her expression when I told her that every
drink comes with free food. I'd never seen her so happy. Apparently the prices
in France are a bit steeper when it comes to food and beverages.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Saturday May 19 -
Today is the big day. Mallory and I have tickets to the Alhambra. As excited as
I am, I realize that I must see a doctor first. I successfully find the Health
Center and navigate the system. The doctor saw me promptly and verified my
suspicions that I had strep throat. The good news is that I now had a
prescription that would make me feel a whole lot better. I don't know if it was
a placebo effect or not, but I felt better almost immediately. On the way to
the Alhambra, Mallory and I grabbed a quick lunch in el Centro and
window-shopped around some vintage clothing shops. Then we experienced the
Alhambra. All I can say is that the views from the castle were some of the most
beautiful I've ever seen. It was breathtaking and it made me a little dizzy to
try to make sense of how great the expanse was that lay before me. I couldn't
help but pretend I was a Moorish princess strolling through the lavish gardens
and colorful courtyards of the sultan's castle. And standing in the chambers
where Washington Irving's (North American writer who stayed at the Alhambra and
wrote the famous Los Cuentos de la Alhambra) had stayed, I was inspired to
write and read and experience it all. For dinner, Melissa, Mallory, and I got
tapas with our friends Rafa and Miguel. Rafa is an Old English teacher at the
University and a lover of languages, so he is always ready to teach me words
and phrases in Spanish. It's always a great time hanging out with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday May 20 - It's Sunday morning, and you know what that
means ---church! Although Mallory and I are not normally church-goers, we
wanted to experience a mass held in Spanish. We were also dying to see the
inside of the big, beautiful Catedral de Granada. It was humbling. After mass,
we visited the Capilla Real (the Royal Chapel), where los Reyes Catolicos
(Catholic King and Queen) Isabel and Fernando are buried. While they used to be
in the Alhambra grounds in the monastery de San Francisco, they have since been
moved to this location. It was a bit chilling to be standing at the feet of
such powerful people. The museum was very interesting, and for this reason, I
couldn't help but buy a short book about la Reina Isabel and the role she
played in terms of spreading the Christian faith and unifying the Spanish
Empire. One interaction of note here was one I had with a French couple. Not
understanding the story of Saint John the Baptist, I asked the couple standing
beside me at the altar. As it turns out, they don't speak either of the
languages I speak (Spanish or English), and I don't speak their language
(French). However, given the similarities between Spanish and France, we were
able to negotiate for meaning rather successfully. It was the first time I had
ever used my second language to understand one that is totally foreign to me.
We also popped into a free art museum on the way home from our activities. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monday May 21 - Today was very exciting for me because I
made my first real Spanish amiga! Up until this point, most of my friends have
been male and I was in desperate need of chica time! I met Esther because she
participated in my study. It's also been really nice to finally have a friend from
the university that is close in age to me, seeing as many of the grad students
are a good bit older. I met Esther at la Facultad de Filosofia y Letra, which
is about a three four minute walk from my Facultad. There, I met several of her
friends and they were a ton of fun. We decided to eat together at that time
every Monday. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:
minor-latin;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Wingdings">J</span>
For the rest of the day, I worked and read. Later, I grabbed dinner with some
friends at a cozy little wooden tavern in el centro.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tuesday May 22 - Sticking with the 1 -1 participant
absente/attendance rule, my morning participant showed up, but my evening
participant didn't. After work, I had coffee with my friend and colleague
Francesco. After, we took a walk around the city and ended up at the
manifestacion (demonstration) that was taking place for public education
rights. It was cool to see the people stand up for education. I am a World Languages
Spanish Education major, so I am glad I was able to witness first-hand the
political upheaval that is the current public education system in Spain. In
other news, today was Alvaro's 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday - Feliz Cumpleanos
chico! We got tapas with the whole group tonight. Today, I finally ran out of
space in my Daily Spanish Vocabulary notebook, so I bought a new one and am
already digging in. <span style="font-family:Wingdings;mso-ascii-font-family:

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday May 23 - Today we have our weekly department
meeting again, so I went to the University at 9am for the presentation, which
was held by a visiting scholar named Patricia. Another thing of note is that I
had my first media de tomate (bread with tomato paste) for breakfast. I was
advised by my Spanish friends that this was a must-do while in Granada. It was
tasty, but I have to admit, I do love my regular tostada con mermelada y
mantequila (toast with jelly and butter). Unfortunately, my 10am participant
was a no show. However, I realized that I forgot to send her a reminder email
the night before so I can really only blame myself. But now, I won't likely forget
to email my participants again in the future. After realizing my participant
was not coming, I headed up to the sala de becarios to code the data from the latest
LHQs I had received. I spent the afternoon doing that as well as sending out
reminders to the rest of this week's participants. Around two o'clock, I had
lunch with Amelia at the cafeteria and after, I booked my bus ticket to Malaga
for the weekend. I then ran my second participant (she actually came!). I then
tried to grab groceries and toiletries for the apartment, but realized that I
needed to stop at an ATM first. I must have tried close to 10 ATMs but my card
was rejected by all of them. That freaked me out a little, but I ended up
buying groceries with my card and decided I would try to withdrawl cash again
in the morning (which worked, thankfully). Tonight, I made some dinner, wrote a
little, and turned in early.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">*On a final note: I just realized today that I no longer
have Peanut Butter and Jelly hunger pangs. Usually it's the thing I crave most.
But over the last couple weeks, I've been licking my lips for bocadillos de
chorizo y queso more than anything else. It seems that even my stomach has
flicked its switch to Spanish mode!</p>
