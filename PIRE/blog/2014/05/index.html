            I cant believe how fast time has gone here in Lund! I am happy to report that I have 4 participants completed. Everyone who has come is really excited to take part in the project. We are running into some issues. We are looking for Native Swedish &nbsp;speakers without any knowledge of the German language . But a&nbsp;large portions of Native Swedish speakers had to take German growing up. We are also competing with final schedules<div><br /></div><div>Yesterday was <span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">Ascension Day</span><font color="#454545" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp;here in Sweden. It marks the 40th day of Easter. It also means that the&nbsp;university &nbsp;was closed for the day! With this free time a friend and I headed into&nbsp;Malmo. Only a ten minute train ride made malmo an easy day trip. We spend time on the Western Harbor and had some lunch. The weather was a little chilly but most outdoor&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;provide blankets for customers ( how cute!) So we were were just fine. &nbsp;I plan&nbsp;on heading into&nbsp;Copenhagen</span></font><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;for the weekend as well!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/malmo.jpg"><img alt="malmo.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/malmo-thumb-200x112-401640.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;A picture from the day trip!</span></div>

            So among other things that have happened in the past two weeks, I've learned that I'm really bad at updating blogs and I think that's just a fact of life that we're all going to have to accept!

Luckily, Chinese only has about 423 distinct syllables, so I figure I'll just memorize the phonetic representations of all of them and go from there (and a large portion are extremely similar to English).

            <div>Hola a todos,</div><div><br /></div><div>Things are going swell here in Granada.</div><div><br /></div><div>The process of recruiting and testing participants has finally started. So far all five of my participants have been awesome. Everyone seems to be very concerned about my results and try so incredibly hard to be a good participant. I love it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>They also tell me they really enjoy doing the study (whatever floats your boat I guess), and they tell their bilingual friends to participate too! This is great because it is quite difficult finding proficient L2 English speakers in a city so Spanish dominant. I've already ran through my database of previous participants from other studies and have resorted to fliers. Today I went to the Centro de Lenguas Modernas to post a few. Also, another researcher in the lab informed me that she is also looking for Spanish-English bilinguals, so we decided to collaborate.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Last Thursday, a PhD student defended her thesis, so Kyra and I had the opportunity to go out for drinks to celebrate with the entire lab. This was a great way to get to know everyone! We went to a bar called MasQueVinos and had tapas galore! That is one thing I love about this town-- Free food with EVERY drink. I'll be expecting this when I return to State College.</div><div><br /></div><div>Last Saturday Kyra and I traveled to the Sierra Nevada mountains with high hopes of reaching the summit to see Africa. It was such a beautiful hike that words cannot express. It was also way more intense than we had expected, with high winds, snow, and freezing temperatures. Also &nbsp;towards the end of the hike the fog seeped in. Lots and lots of fog. Here's a picture:</div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/P1050833.jpg"><img alt="P1050833.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/P1050833-thumb-200x138-401622.jpg" width="200" height="138" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></div><div>We also had the opportunity to be in Spain during the European Cup finals while Real Madrid played Atletico Madrid! Very cool experience. Every bar on every street was packed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As for this weekend, we have plans to travel to Nerja, a beautiful beach town on the coast of the Mediterranean. That's it for now!</div><div><br /></div><div>As I wait patiently for people to respond to my fliers :)</div><div><br /></div><div>Paige</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div>

            <div>Hola a todos,</div><div><br /></div><div>Things are going swell here in Granada.</div><div><br /></div><div>The process of recruiting and testing participants has finally started. So far all five of my participants have been awesome. Everyone seems to be very concerned about my results and try so incredibly hard to be a good participant. I love it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>They also tell me they really enjoy doing the study (whatever floats your boat I guess), and they tell their bilingual friends to participate too! This is great because it is quite difficult finding proficient L2 English speakers in a city so Spanish dominant. I've already ran through my database of previous participants from other studies and have resorted to fliers. Today I went to the Centro de Lenguas Modernas to post a few. Also, another researcher in the lab informed me that she is also looking for Spanish-English bilinguals, so we decided to collaborate.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Last Thursday, a PhD student defended her thesis, so Kyra and I had the opportunity to go out for drinks to celebrate with the entire lab. This was a great way to get to know everyone! We went to a bar called MasQueVinos and had tapas galore! That is one thing I love about this town-- Free food with EVERY drink. I'll be expecting this when I return to State College.</div><div><br /></div><div>Last Saturday Kyra and I traveled to the Sierra Nevada mountains with high hopes of reaching the summit to see Africa. It was such a beautiful hike that words cannot express. It was also way more intense than we had expected, with high winds, snow, and freezing temperatures. Also &nbsp;towards the end of the hike the fog seeped in. Lots and lots of fog. Here's a picture:</div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/P1050833.jpg"><img alt="P1050833.jpg" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/P1050833-thumb-200x138-401622.jpg" width="200" height="138" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></div><div>We also had the opportunity to be in Spain during the European Cup finals while Real Madrid played Atletico Madrid! Very cool experience. Every bar on every street was packed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As for this weekend, we have plans to travel to Nerja, a beautiful beach town on the coast of the Mediterranean. That's it for now!</div><div><br /></div><div>As I wait patiently for people to respond to my fliers :)</div><div><br /></div><div>Paige</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div>

            <p class="MsoNormal">Hello again, PIRE blog followers. It has been another great
week here in Granada. Since I last posted I have already tested 4 participants.
I have been in contact with 37 interested participants, 29 of which are already
scheduled. I have been very lucky that there are so many willing participants.
I emailed a ton of people last week, and a lot of the people who responded also
said they had friends who would be interested as well. News of my study has
definitely spread through the university very quickly. I wasn't worried too
much about finding willing participants, but now that I've been in contact with
so many, I definitely feel more at ease. Most of my evenings and weekends are
spent organizing my schedule to fit participants. With the amount of people
that have responded already and the amount of time I have to test participants,
I might actually have to turn participants away come June. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since last week, Paige and I have done more exploring of the
city. We were even able to go out with a group of people from the lab because
Julia just defended her thesis this past Thursday. It was nice to get to meet
some new people who we haven't met yet and to get to know better those that we
have met. This past weekend Paige and I had the opportunity to hike the Sierra
Nevada. Our view of the city and the mountains was beautiful. Although we
didn't have any winter clothes, we still managed to make it pretty high up into
the mountains before we turned around. We took a ton of pictures. Here's one
that I took of our view.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/pic%20103.JPG"><img alt="pic 103.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/pic 103-thumb-200x150-401620.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1em;">Paige and I have a lot of fun things planned for the coming
week. Our tour of the Alhambra is next Monday, so I am very excited about that.
So far we've only been able to see the outside. It's magnificent, so I'm sure
the inside will be just as spectacular. We also planned a trip to Nerja for
this weekend. It's is a beach town not too far from here. The pictures we've
seen are beautiful, so we will definitely have pictures of our own to share
with you all next time. I will be testing 6 more participants before this weekend
though, so for right now, our trip seems like a long way away.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            I can't believe it's finally here! The day when I can safely say: No. More. Splicing. After hours upon hours spent breaking sentences up by the word, I have all my stimuli ready to go! I'm so excited to start running participants. Hopefully, I'll start to see some results in the next couple weeks, because I'll be presenting at one of Dr. James McQueen's biweekly lab meetings within the next month.<div><br /></div><div>Recruiting participants has been a slow process, but I'm got a couple great people helping me out. I have a few people lined up, and Megan has kindly offered to be my guinea pig for the trial run of the experiment. Fingers crossed everything goes smoothly! It's really amazing seeing everything come together after months of effort.</div><div><br /></div><div>This weekend, I finally got to see Nijmegen. I have absolutely no sense of direction, so I never ventured farther than the lab and the grocery store without Megan holding my hand (metaphorically speaking). On Saturday, we went into the city center to visit the market. My jaw dropped when we rounded that last corner and saw the line of booths. I couldn't believe it was the same city I've been living in the past two months! The only word I can think of to describe downtown Nijmegen is charming. The architecture, outdoor cafes, river, and trees all combine to give the city a feeling like it was pulled right from a fairy tale.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of fairy tale, the highlight of the journey downtown had to be our brief tour of the castle that was built by Charlemagne. I had read about the building in a guide to the Netherlands my mom got me for Christmas, and I was so excited to tour my first castle! I figured I'd spend a couple of hours wandering down drafty, stone corridors and climbing the winding staircases of turrets. I failed to consider the implication of touring a castle that was built almost a thousand years ago. Megan and I spent about thirty seconds walking around the curved brick wall that was the only remnant of the&nbsp;<font face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;">Kasteel het Valkhof. I couldn't help but laugh at my&nbsp;naivety.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;"><br /></span></font></div><div><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: 19.5px;">All in all, this has been a week of accomplishments. I finally finished preparing my experiment, and I finally saw the city I've called home the past two weeks. If my next five weeks are as productive as this one, I'll know Nijmegen better than I know Philadelphia, and I'll have plenty of good data to analyze!&nbsp;</span></font></div>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's hard to believe that I've already been in Germany for
almost two weeks.&nbsp; I guess that's what
happens when you're always busy!&nbsp; Abby
and I have been recruiting almost every day, but we're competing against final
exams at the moment, so it hasn't been going as smoothly as we liked.&nbsp; I've ran three participants this far, and I
am very happy with how things are looking.&nbsp;
I have two more lined up for next week at the moment, and hopefully I
get more people coming in as finals end for the students.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany is
truly beginning to feel like home.&nbsp; I've
conquered the German washing machines, the public transportation, and have been
a frequent customer at the local markets.&nbsp;
I've especially enjoyed trying to maintain a conversation with the
locals (they think I know more German than I really do, so I just smile and nod
most of the time). <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abby and I
were able to take some time to visit the beautiful city of Heidelberg, and it
was definitely an incredible trip!&nbsp; We
stopped by the Heidelberg Castle that was destroyed centuries ago, but the
parts that were preserved were not only incredibly interesting to hear about,
but they were incredibly beautiful.&nbsp; I
find it fascinating how two cities (Mannheim and Heidelberg) can be so
different but so close to each other.&nbsp; It
was definitely a neat cultural experience and I really enjoyed it! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the next
week approaches, I am aiming to get up to 10 participants and explore Mannheim
a little bit more.&nbsp; My time here has been
absolutely amazing and I am so thankful that PIRE has given me this
opportunity!<o:p></o:p></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal">Greetings from Granada! It has been a long but eventful week
since leaving the States. The flights to get here went as smoothly as they
could have. I was very lucky to have been awake not only to watch the sun rise,
but also to look out the window and see the very first glimpse of Europe as we
flew over the coast of Portugal. Getting to look down on a new continent was
very exciting. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So far, here in Spain, I have felt very welcomed. Manolo
gave me the grand tour of the apartment and has been very helpful in pointing both
Paige and I in the right direction to find the bus stop, the grocery store,
good places to eat, etc. He brought us into the lab this past Thursday and we
were able to meet Teresa and many other people who work in the lab. Everyone
was very welcoming and helped us whenever we needed assistance with anything
which is good because we seem to have a lot of questions. The facility itself is
gorgeous inside, but it has an even more amazing view of the city. We were able
to see the rooms where we will be working for the next 7 weeks, and we were
also able to attend the weekly lab meeting.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the cultural front, I have slowly been getting used to
living here in Granada. The jet lag that was around for the first few days has finally
disappeared. I'm not quite used to taking a siesta and eating dinner at 10 pm,
but I'm sure I will be in due time. I have taken the opportunity to walk around
the city as much as possible this week. So far Paige and I have seen beautiful
views of the Alhambra, the Cathedral, the Sierra Nevada, and many other
wonderful parts of the city. We're planning on taking tours of all Granada's
landmarks and taking as many pictures as we can. We even booked our ticket to
see the Alhambra. Much to our surprise, tickets were sold out until June. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm looking forward to testing participants. I started
sending out emails yesterday to recruit participants, and I already have 8
people scheduled. It's very exciting. Hopefully I continue to find willing
participants. Granada is, after all, teeming with monolingual Spanish speakers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I hope all is well in State College, PA.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/granada%20blog.JPG"><img alt="granada blog.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/granada blog-thumb-200x150-401520.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="text-align: center; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" /></a></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><br /></p>

            It's hard to believe that a week has already gone by! I'm starting to feel much more accommodated here, and I'm learning how to navigate myself around the city like a local. Not really.. But I know how to get to my apartment without a map!&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Manolo, my host who is also a member of the lab here, gave me and Kyra a grand tour of the department building last Thursday. Let me just say, el Centro de Investigación Mente, Cerebro Y Comportamiento (CIMCYC) is a BEAUTIFUL building. Every thing is new, and white, and clean and it's situated on top of a hill that has a great view overlooking Granada. This is what we see from the balcony outside our assigned lab room:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/P1050640.JPG"><img alt="P1050640.JPG" src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/P1050640-thumb-200x150-401517.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a><div>We also had our first lab meeting last Thursday. Everyone is very warm and welcoming. It's funny to me how similar the lab here is to the BiLD lab. Everyone speaks AT LEAST two different languages almost fluently, and the set up of the lab meetings is basically the same. Sitting in the lab and watching how people test participants is exactly the same procedure as well. It's actually pretty cool.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm starting to schedule participants to come in for my study, and I'm getting way more excited and giddy than I thought I'd be. I have two people scheduled already. I'm looking forward to running through the study with a real participant for the first time, woohoo!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Until next time,</div><div>Paige</div>

I feel like time has flown. I spent my academic year last year in Germany and
it feels so great to be back. Mannheim is a really terrific city but is much
different from Freiburg--where I stayed during my year abroad--in that it feels
somehow much more industrial. From nearly every point in the city you can see
one of the big giant cranes that are spread out along the harbor, and while
there are green areas in the city, I'm not constantly surrounded by forest and
mountains like I was last year. (Freiburg, unlike Mannheim, lies directly in
the Schwarzwald, or Black Forest.) Mannheim has its own quirks though: It
offers a more modern take on German city life and is also home to many people
of Turkish heritage, which I find really cool. There are places in the city
that have streets of Turkish bakeries and restaurants and where all the signs
are in Turkish. To me, it's reminiscent of areas like Chinatown in New York
City and I'm eager to explore these areas more (and hopefully locate a really
terrific D</font></span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">öner in the process).</font><o:p></o:p></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image (1)-401508.html" onclick="window.open('http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image (1)-401508.html','popup','width=640,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image (1)-thumb-300x300-401508.jpeg" width="300" height="300" alt="mannheim" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">What I really love about Mannheim is that it, like many other
German cities, also has frequent farmers' markets. The one here is three times
a week in the main square; everything from vegetables and fruits to fresh
cheese, bread, and big flower bouquets is available for purchase. Molly and I
went yesterday and I bought lots of fresh veggies. It was such a pleasure to be
able to cook for myself with all my fresh ingredients and I ended up eating
dinner with my Mitbewohner, or roommates, who funnily enough are two
engineering students from Alabama. They don't speak almost any German (which,
I'll admit is somewhat disappointing as I was hoping to practice my German at
home with my roommates) but it was fun trying to teach them German phrases and
spread some of my knowledge about Germany (for instance, buy anything you might
need for the weekend ahead of time as almost everything closes early Saturday
and completely on Sunday, and trying to find things like Lysol wipes or clothes
hangers at grocery stores is an exercise in futility). <o:p></o:p></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 0.5120000000000001em;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">Another really tremendous thing about Mannheim is that it
lies a mere 30 minutes by Stra</font></span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">ßenbahn
away from</font> </span></font><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">Heidelberg. Molly and I make the trek out today and did a
tour of the Heidelberg Castle, which overlooks the Neckar and the rest of the
city. After going on a tour of the castle, we bummed around the city and did
some shopping.</font>&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font style="font-size: 0.5120000000000001em;"><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image-401509.html" onclick="window.open('http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image-401509.html','popup','width=640,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/assets_c/2014/05/image-thumb-300x300-401509.jpeg" width="300" height="300" alt="heidelberg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 1.25em;"><font style="font-size: 1em;"><font style="font-size: 0.6400000000000001em;">I really enjoyed being in Heidelberg because it feels much more
"German" to me. That is, it has the cobblestone streets and old façade look
that I really want from my German cities; until I went to Heidelberg, I hadn't
realized how much I missed that in Mannheim. Regardless of the lack of "German-ness"
(as I would call it) of Mannheim, I'm still very much enjoying my time here and
I'm eager to see more of what this city has to offer!&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            Arriving in Beijing on Monday was quite a culture shock!<div><br /></div><div>Surprisingly, I was not too jet lagged to start with. I think it helps that the time difference between State College and Beijing is exactly 12 hours, and since I didn't get much sleep before I drove to the airport at 4am Sunday (because I don't think it's physically possible to fall asleep before 11pm), <i>any</i>&nbsp;sleep I got on the plane from Dulles to Beijing was during nighttime in China. However, over the next few days, jet lag started kicking in, and around 3pm my body started to decide that even though I wasn't tired at all, I should desire nothing more than to go to bed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, I am insanely grateful that the advisor here, Taomei, asked one of her students, Jie, to meet me at the airport, because without that, there's no way I would have found my way to the apartment that I am staying at. Unlike my experience with many European languages, where if you speak slow each person can probably pick up enough cognates and hand gestures to make some basic communication, it's impossible to break the language barrier if you don't speak Chinese here. Most of the population knows only very basic English, if any at all, and since I know only a few phrases in Mandarin, it can be hard to communicate my intent and all but impossible to ask questions. Overall, having people who can speak both English and Mandarin come along with me has been almost a necessity in certain situations.</div><div><br /></div><div>The biggest thing I've noticed so far is that I certainly stand out as a foreigner. I've been told that the area I'm living in is made up of almost 100% Chinese people, so a white person is quite noticeable. Just walking down the street I've been getting quite a few intense stares of curiosity. I've gone to a few places for food a handful of times and even though I've only been here less than a week, the people working there already remember what I like to buy because I stand out so much! I've also had quite a few people timidly come up to me and ask if they can take pictures with me or of me and their kids. Since I'm fairly certain I'm not a celebrity here, I did some quick Googling and discovered that that's actually a pretty common experience among foreigners in China (apparently, the people who do this tend to also be tourists to the city and come from areas where foreigners rarely visit).</div><div><br /></div><div>Most people I've encountered do seem to be &nbsp;accepting of foreigners. There are some word that are incredibly hard to pronounce for an English speaker, such as baozi, which is a delicious little meat filled bread pocket. It's pronounced /bɑʊ.t͡sʐ/, and although I have no problem with the /t͡s/ (which is like an "sh" sound pronounced where you pronounce "s"), but going from that to a "z" sound is not something I'm capable of. Every time I struggle out my best pronunciation of the word, whoever I am ordering from is happy to repeat it slowly to let me listen.</div><div><br /></div><div>The food so far has been fantastic. I've tried literally everything I can get my hands on (and that's <i>a lot</i>&nbsp;of food). Compared to the United States, food is extremely cheap. Baozi is my favorite food by far, and it can be had for about 2 RMB or 0.32 USD. Not quite as steep as my $2 muffin every morning in State College at Au Bon Pain. There's a nearby road lined with market stalls selling a delicious variety of foods; I'm slowly making my way through trying everything.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2257.png"><img alt="A Bowl of Noodles from a Small Vendor" src="" width="200" height="150" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div><a href="http://cls.psu.edu/PIRE/blog/IMG_2254.png"><img alt="Bread Pocket with Chives and Egg" src="" width="200" height="266" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></div><div>Meals in restaurants are also amazing, although they taste nothing like Chinese food in the US. They also seem to be very vegetable-heavy, which is quite a shock to a self-proclaimed carnivore like me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Chopsticks are also the hardest thing in the world to use. Seriously. If America wants to curb its obesity epidemic, it only needs to replace all forks with chopsticks. Luckily, since I've had quite a few meals with Mandarin-English bilinguals, they've been nice enough to ask for a fork when I start to struggle!</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't think this post really has a conclusion. And I think the whole thing was kind of rambled. But I'm still jet lagged and sleepy, and I'm totally going to use that as an excuse!</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After three days of running around
Germany, I can finally say that I have arrived and settled in safely!&nbsp; The flight started off quite
interesting.&nbsp; We were about to take off,
and as we were leaving, the pilot made an announcement that the breaks locked
up and we needed to turn around to get them checked out by maintenance.&nbsp; They said it would take about a half hour, so
I just pulled out my book and began to read.&nbsp;
That half hour turned into a two hour delay, but luckily I didn't have
to worry at all about a connecting flight.&nbsp;
Despite all the complaints from the people in the seats around me, I was
happy that the plane stopped to get things checked out; better safe than sorry!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Before the plane fiasco even
happened, I had a very interesting encounter in the airport.&nbsp; A bunch of my friends are traveling to Italy
for an HDFS minor program this summer, and I ran into one of them at the
Philadelphia airport.&nbsp; We then found out
that we were on the same flight!&nbsp; It
truly is a really small world!&nbsp; It was
nice to see a familiar face, but what was even better was that my fellow PIRE
peer, Abby, was on the flight with me.&nbsp;
It was nice to have someone familiar with Germany with me as I ventured
out to get the train from Frankfurt to Mannheim.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Upon arriving in Mannheim, I headed
straight for my apartment.&nbsp; I assumed
that they would be at the apartment waiting for me since they knew I was coming...but
I was wrong.&nbsp; I sat outside my apartment
for about an hour hoping they would stop by, and then I finally gave up.&nbsp; Abby and I went to buy our phones to reach
our participants, and attempted to call the apartment owner...but my phone didn't
work.&nbsp; Luckily, right down the street was
a small shop where you could make phone calls and use the computers.&nbsp; With Abby's help, we were able to contact my
landlord and he came right by to let me in.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Let me tell you, he sure came to
the apartment in style!&nbsp; He was driving a
convertible (the weather here is beautiful - 65 degrees and sunny) and as he
was going to park, he went too fast and ran straight into the back of the car
in front of him and then backed into his parking space like it was completely
normal to drive that way.&nbsp; After being
jet-lagged and awake for over 24 hours, I found it quite funny.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After all the fun of getting
settled in and exploring the city, it was time to meet up with Dr. Hopp and
start recruiting participants.&nbsp; He is so
tall that one of his strides was about 4 of mine, so I was practically running
around his building!&nbsp; He is really great
and really helpful, and I am very excited to get started actually running
participants.&nbsp; Recruitment starts
tomorrow, so wish me and Abby some luck!<o:p></o:p></p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            As the plane descended below the cloud line, I saw my first glimpse of the Netherlands! Two words immediately came to mind: lush and wet. There are open pastures, leafy trees, and rich shrubbery stretching for miles. Scattered between fields and roadways are canals; at least, I think they're canals. These bodies of water that are too big to be considered streams but too small to be considered rivers crisscross the countryside. The landscape is beautiful and unlike anything I've ever seen in the US.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Despite my absolutely awful sense of direction, I managed to make it on the train to Nijmegen without a hitch. I tried to keep my eyes open on the ride to the city so I could take in as much of the landscape as possible, but it was a lost cause. I did manage to note before I passed out with my head against the window how the line between rural and suburb seems pretty blurred over here. Fields of cows, sheep, and horses are located next to warehouses, towns, and train stations. From the window of my desk right now, it looks like the city of Nijmegen shares its location with a forest.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of my desk, the apartment Megan and I share is great! Megan met me at the train station, and the two of us took a ten minute taxi ride to an apartment building that looks like it's made of purple brick. All the doors to the apartment open with key fobs, so I feel really high tech every time I come home and wave my fob over the sensor to open the front door. We share a one bedroom apartment with a cozy living room and kitchen area. There's a nice, big desk where I'm currently writing this post. You can definitely tell this apartment is for visiting scholars though; the desk alone is almost as big as our kitchen! I think my favorite feature of the apartment is the funky bright red floor that matches our comfy living room chairs.</div><div><br /></div><div>After I napped for a couple of hours, Megan showed me the building where I will be working. It seems really nice! There's a cool indoor garden outside the cafe where I'll get lunch sometimes. Megan then took me to buy some groceries. I've lived on campus the past two years, so this was my first time ever attempting to stock a fridge completely on my own before. Add in the fact that everything was written in Dutch, and it was a recipe for disaster! Luckily, I had Megan to help me out. She has been absolutely amazing in helping me get around here. I wouldn't be able to function without her. Kudos to all the PIRE kids who are going at this alone! I hope your survival instincts are stronger than mine.</div><div><br /></div><div>While all things travel-related went smoothly, I've already suffered several technical difficulties. First, my personal laptop decided it doesn't want to work over here. It keep shutting down after a few minutes and now doesn't even recognize when it's being charged. Thank you, PIRE, for sending me abroad with two computers! The PIRE laptop works great; it's actually faster than my Mac. I just have to adjust from switching over from a Mac to a Dell. I had a minor issue with email yesterday too. For some reason, I was receiving emails without a problem, but I couldn't send any. Once again, Megan came to my rescue. Now I'm just hoping this post actually gets published. This is Take 2 of my entry, because the first one didn't save correctly. Now I know to copy a post in case it doesn't save once I attempt to send it out into the blogisphere. Live and learn! Speaking of learning, it's time to get back to my sentence splicing so I finish preparing my experiment. I'll be sure to post again soon!</div>
