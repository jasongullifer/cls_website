<strong>Bio:</strong> <Br /> <br />
Dr. Tan is Professor of Linguistics and Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Founder & Co-Director of State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Hong Kong. He received his Ph.D. in psycholinguistics from the University of Hong Kong in 1995. Following a post-doctoral research training in Learning Research and Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh, he started to work in Hong Kong in 1999. In the past ten years, Dr. Tan has performed research in the field of reading and reading disorders at the University of Hong Kong, the Research Imaging Center of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, University of Pittsburgh, and Intramural Research Programs of the National Institute of Mental Health of NIH. Dr. Tan is a Professor of Psycholinguistics in the School of Humanities. He has been an adjunct associate professor of Department of Pediatrics at Georgetown University Medical Center and has served as an associate editor of the journal Human Brain Mapping and a member of the editorial board of Brain and Language. Currently he is an editorial board member of Human Brain Mapping, Neuroscience, and Journal of Neurolinguistics. 
 <Br /><br />
Dr. Tan's main research interest is to use neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) and cognitive techniques to investigate neuroanatomical and cognitive mechanisms underlying language processing, language learning, memory, and attention. The studies conducted by Dr. Tan and his collaborators have shown that the left middle frontal gyrus responsible for verbal working memory critically mediates Chinese character recognition, whereas the left posterior temporoparietal regions critical for English reading are less involved in Chinese reading. He also demonstrated that the neural systems for Chinese and English reading are shaped by learning experience of the two written languages and that activity levels of the left middle frontal cortex serve as a neurobiological marker of Chinese dyslexia. His current work is focused on the study of functions of left middle frontal gyrus in Chinese reading, how language interacts with perception at the neuroanatomical level, and the neural systems underlying native and second language acquisition.
