<strong>Bio: </strong><Br /><br />
My name is Felix Huitian and I am an undergraduate student at Pennsylvania State University. I 

am a triple major in Italian, History, and International Politics with a minor in Spanish. I have a 

profound passion for languages and neuroscience; and I intend to enroll into medical school after 

graduation.  <br/><br/>

Through the Center of Language Science, I had the wonderful opportunity to work as a research 

assistant under Dr. Matthew Carlson. In our study, we focus on how two languages, with 

opposing phonotactic constraints, impact speech perception in Spanish-English bilinguals. For 

example, English allows words to begin with an /s/+consonant (#sC) cluster at the beginning of a 

word. Spanish, on the other hand, does not allow an #sC cluster at the beginning of a word and it 

is repaired with the addition of a vowel, usually an e. Spanish-English bilinguals are able to 

acquire these two contrasting phonotactic systems and we are looking for evidence of priming; 

the potential of one language to influence the other. With the help of PIRE, the project will 

continue in Granada, Spain and I will be able to compare the performances of the two bilingual 

groups (one in the US, the other in Spain), in terms of priming, using a Lexical Decision Task 

and other measures.<br/><br/>

Beyond research, I am enrolled in free online courses through Coursera, Edx, Learn Liberty, and 

Future Learn. I constantly expose myself to new ideas and I enjoy making every single day a 

new learning experience. I've also started experimenting with cooking and it turns out, I can 

make a really good margherita pizza. Although I have a long road ahead, it is through hard work 

and dedication that I will be able to reach new heights of intellectual maturity. <br/><br/>

I want to take the time and thank the PIRE community for giving me the wonderful opportunity 

to participate in this venture. My appreciation extends beyond words and I hope my project adds 

valuable knowledge to linguistics and science. Furthermore, I wish to congratulate my fellow 

PIRE cohort and wish them the best of luck in terms of their research, their education, and future 

careers. It is through our combined efforts that we can contribute greatly to the society around us 

and may we continue to do so as the leaders of tomorrow.
