In order to further enhance our collaborative research, we would like you to provide a few general comments on the following:\n
(1) How might the process be such that not only our students benefit from the visit but your research and your lab also benefit from this process?\n
Comment: ".$_SEVENCOMMENT_."\n
(2) Are there specific ways in which the student visiting process can be changed from its current procedure that you feel would be best in the research and cultural contexts of your institution?\n
Comment: ".$_SEVENCOMMENT_."\n
(3) Are there any other thoughts that you would like to share with us about the PIRE project?\n
